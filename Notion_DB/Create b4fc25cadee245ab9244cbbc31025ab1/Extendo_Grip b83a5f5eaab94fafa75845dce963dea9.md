### Mechanical Crafting[]

## Usage[]

When held, the Extendo Grip increases the player’s reach by 4 blocks and increases knockback. When held in the offhand, these bonuses are retained.

When the Extendo Grip is used to break blocks, place blocks, or hit mobs, it will lose durability regardless of whether it’s in the main or offhand unless used in conjunction with a filled Copper Backtank, in which case the tank’s air is used instead.

Much like super glue and sandpaper, it can be enchanted with unbreaking and mending books.

It is also possible to hold 2 to increase your knockback and reach even more. This will give you an advancement.

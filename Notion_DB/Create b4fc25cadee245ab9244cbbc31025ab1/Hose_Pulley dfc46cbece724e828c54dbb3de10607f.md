## Usage[]

When Rotational Force is given to the Hose Pully, it can extend the hose infinitely. A Fluid Pump is required for the hose to drain liquids. It will drain a body of liquid down to the level of the hose.

If a liquid source is at least 10,000 blocks (Configurable,) the Hose Pulley considers it to be infinite, drawing the liquid from it without actually draining the source.

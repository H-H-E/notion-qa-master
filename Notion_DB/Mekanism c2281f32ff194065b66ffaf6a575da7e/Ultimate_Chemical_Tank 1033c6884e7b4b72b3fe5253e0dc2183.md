**Chemical Tanks** are used to store Gases. They can be placed as a block and can interact with Pressurized Tubes. They come in the four tiers, each tier being double the capacity and output rate of its predecessor. It can store the following gases:

Gas | Dirty Slurry | Clean Slurry | Infuse Type |
— | — | — | — |
Antimatter | Dirty Copper Slurry | Clean Copper Slurry | Biomass |
Chlorine | Dirty Gold Slurry | Clean Gold Slurry | Carbon |
Deuterium | Dirty Iron Slurry | Clean Iron Slurry | Diamond |
D-T Fuel | Dirty Lead Slurry | Clean Lead Slurry | Funghi |
Ehtylene | Dirty Osmium Slurry | Clean Osmium Slurry | Gold |
Fissile Fuel | Dirty Tin Slurry | Clean Tin Slurry | Redstone |
Gaseous Brine | Dirty Uranium Slurry | Clean Uranium Slurry | Refined Obsidian |

For more information about each gas, see Gases.

**Note:** Some mods, like JAOPCA, may add additional slurries that are not listed above. Please do not edit and list them as they do not belong to Mekanism by default.

## Inventory Inputting/Outputting

The **Chemical Tank**, when placed in the world, has two slots in its inventory.

The slot with a blue negative sign is the input slot. If you place something that contains gas (e.g. a chemical tank containing Oxygen) into this slot, the chemical tank will drain the item of its content as much as possible.

The slot with a red positive sign is the output slot. If you place something that can store gas (e.g. a chemical tank) into this slot, the chemical tank will fill the item as much as possible.

## Configurations

By default, the chemical tank will be set to auto-eject for all substances. The side that the chemical tank will be auto-ejecting is the side with a red dot. This can all be configured, of course, in its Side Config.

Like other machines, chemical tanks’ GUI has a dump feature:

- Idle: The chemical tank will not dump anything.
- Dump Excess: The chemical tank will limit it’s storage to only 99.5% of its full capacity, while dumping any excess., thus causing the tank to never be full.
- Dump: The chemical tank will continuously dump its entire inventory, attempting to leave none left.

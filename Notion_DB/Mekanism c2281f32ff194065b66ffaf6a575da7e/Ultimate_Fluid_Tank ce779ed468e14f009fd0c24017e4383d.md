**Fluid Tanks** are storage blocks to store fluids. The amount of fluid (mb) a fluid tank can store is based on its tier. It will retain its inventory when broken. You may use a Mechanical Pipe that is set to Pull in order to extract the fluid out of the tank. Fluid tanks can store the following fluids:

Fluid |
— |
Brine |
Bioethanol |
Heavy Water |
Lava |
Liquid Chlorine |
Liquid Deuterium |
Liquid D-T Fuel |
Liquid Ethylene |
Liquid Hydrofluoric Acid |
Liquid Hydrogen |
Liquid Hydrogen Chloride |
Liquid Lithium |
Liquid Oxygen |
Liquid Sodium |
Liquid Steam |
Liquid Sulfur Dioxide |
Liquid Sulfur Trioxide |
Liquid Tritium |
Sulfuric Acid |
Water |

**Note:** The list above is based on Mekanism being the only mod. Other mods can add more fluids (that are not on the list above) which can also be stored in Mekanism’s Fluid Tanks.

### Bucket Mode

You can hold shift and scroll to change Bucket Mode. If bucket mode is set to True, the fluid tank will act like a bucket, being able to physically dump fluid out (shift right click) and scoop up fluid (right click).

However, by setting it to True, it also removes the ability to place the fluid tank. Bucket mode must be set to off in order to place the fluid tank.

## Configurations

Shift right click on any fluid tank with a Configurator (set on any mode besides Wrench, Rotate, and Empty) to turn on auto-eject. Once auto-eject is turned on, the color (green, red, blue, purple, or black) will light up to indicate so. Note that fluid tanks will only auto-eject from the bottom.

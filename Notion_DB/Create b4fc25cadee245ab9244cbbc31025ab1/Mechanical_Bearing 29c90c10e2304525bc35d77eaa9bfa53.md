### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

When the Mechanical Bearing is connected to a rotating Shaft, right clicking the bearing will start the rotation so long as there is a potential structure connected to the front of it.

### Structure Behavior[]

The structure will rotate. If another Mechanical Bearing is used within a Contraption, facing the same way as the original, the blocks attached to that bearing will keep their alignment as the rest of the structure moves.

### Wrench[]

Shift-right-clicking on a Mechanical Bearing with a Wrench will destroy the Mechanical Bearing and place it in your inventory.

In older versions, the Mechanical Bearing also had the functionality of Windmill Bearings which could be scrolled through with a Wrench.

The structureâ€™s behavior when ceasing movement can be adjusted with a Wrench. It can be told to place the blocks: always, only near the initial angle, or never.

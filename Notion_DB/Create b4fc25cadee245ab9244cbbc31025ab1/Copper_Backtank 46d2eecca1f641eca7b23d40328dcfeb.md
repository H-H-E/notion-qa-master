## Usage[]

When placed, the backtank can be filled with air via Rotational Force. Simply attach a rotating shaft to the shaft at the top of the tank. When worn it provides 4Â () armor points. Currently, it is only used with the Extendo Grip, Diving Helmet, and Potato Cannon. When used with the Diving Helmet it can provide up to 15 minutes of Water Breathing if not enchanted with the capacity enchantment. With Capacity III, it can provide 30 minutes of Water Breathing. It cannot be used with a chestplate, as it uses the chest slot in the inventory.

The player will receive a warning when the Backtank reaches 10% and 0% capacity, respectively.

When rotational force is applied, it fills at seconds of air per second.

The **Solar Generator** harnesses sunlight to create power. The generator is particularly useful for generating passive energy for above-ground machines instead of draining your main stores.

While active, it will output 1200 J/sec (60 J/t) through the bottom of the panel base. It has a small 96 kJ internal power buffer. This Solar Generator’s low output limits its usefulness, but that isn’t the case with its larger cousin, the Advanced Solar Generator.

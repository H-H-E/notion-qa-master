# Nuclear_Waste

Nuclear Waste is a byproduct of running the Fission Reactor, it is Radioactive and if it gets released into the environment it will wreak havoc on your world.
A Small amount is stored in the Reactor itself but should be piped into either a Radioactive Waste Barrel or a Solar Neutron Activator

## Introduction

Ore Processing is the process of multiplying ores to create more ingots. Mekanism ore processing works on Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Osmium Ore, Copper Ore, and Tin Ore. This tutorial will teach you how to set up basic ore processing. If you are not familiar with Mekanism, it is recommended that you check out Tutorials/Getting Started.

## Tier 0

Tier 0 ore processing Tier 0 ore processing is just the regular smelting process. It involves putting ore in a furnace or Energized Smelter and powering it with fuel/energy. You don’t need to set this up because you’ve probably already used it to create materials for a Heat Generator or Metallurgic Infuser.

## Tier 1

Tier 1 ore processing Tier 1 ore processing results in a x2 ingot production. It introduces the Enrichment Chamber, which uses energy to change ores into 2 Dusts each. You can smelt the dusts into ingots using your furnace or Energized Smelter, resulting in 2 ingots per ore.

## Tier 2

Tier 2 ore processing Tier 2 ore processing results in a x3 ingot production. It introduces the Purification Chamber, the Crusher, and the Electrolytic Separator. The Purification Chamber requires Oxygen and energy to change ores into three Clumps each. The clumps can then be put into the Crusher where they are turned into Dirty Dusts. You can put dirty dusts into the Enrichment Chamber where they are turned into regular dusts which can be smelted. After following this process, you will get three ingots per ore.

You can get oxygen by electrolyzing water in the Electrolytic Separator. Gather water using a bucket or Fluid Tank and put it in the input slot. This process also creates Hydrogen which can be used as a fuel for Jetpacks, Flamethrowers, and the Gas-Burning Generator.

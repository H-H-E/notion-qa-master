The **Modification Station** is used for applying modular upgrades to the Meka-Suit and the Meka-Tool in exchange for energy. A part of the Meka-Suit (which the upgrade is compatible with) is inserted into the station along with the upgrade, resulting in the upgrade being applied to the Meka-Suit. It functions similarly to an Anvil or a Power Armor Tinker Table from the Modular Powersuits mod.

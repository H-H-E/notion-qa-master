### Placement[]

Similarly to Nixie Tubes, Display Boards can be aligned to share text. Display Boards can be expanded up to 32 blocks above, below, and to either side, allowing a maximum Display Board size of 32x32. More Display Boards can be placed beyond the limit, however they will not function as part of the main board.

### Text[]

The Display Board must be powered at an RPM of 32 to display text. The Display Board has no stress impact. Use a Name Tag on a line of the Display Board to write the Tagâ€™s contents to it. Each Display Board block can hold 2 lines of text. Lines can be erased using an empty hand. Lines can also be colored by using Dyes or illuminated with Glow Inc Sacs. Items will not be consumed on use.

Display Links can write information to Display Boards.

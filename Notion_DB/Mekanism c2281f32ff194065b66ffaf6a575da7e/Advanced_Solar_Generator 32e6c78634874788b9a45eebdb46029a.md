The **Advanced Solar Generator** is a highly upgraded version of the basic Solar Generator. Construction of an Advanced Solar Generator requires four Solar Generators, but it produces six times the power of its smaller counterpart. It also requires an area of 3x3x3 Blocks in order to be placed. The Advanced Solar Generator only produces power during the day. Universal Cable or other compatible wire can be connected to the side of the base with a green square or the bottom of the Generator. Right-click the generator with a wrench or Configurator set to Rotate to rotate the entire assembly.

## Power Production

By default the Advanced Solar Generator produces 300 J/t in direct sunlight, and can output a maximum of 600 J/t. This amount can be changed inside of the Mekanism Config. Like the Solar Generator, the Advanced Solar Generator does noticeably better in biomes that are hotter, but not too hot. Deserts are no longer the best place for them due to code change meant to more closely match real life (heat is bad for super conductors).

## Gathering Materials and Crafting the Advanced Solar Generator

Before creating the Advanced Solar Generator, you will need access to a Metallurgic Infuser as well as a way to grind ores to obtain Osmium Dust. This can be accomplished by placing the ore in a Crusher, and then a Enrichment Chamber, or by using another mod that has similar machines such as the Grinder or Applied Energistics 2’s Grindstone, a great early-game alternative.

To create the Advanced Solar Generator, the raw materials you will need include:

- 36 Glass Pane (~18 Glass)
- 54 Redstone (see note below)
- 37 Iron Ingot
- 36 Osmium Ingot
- 08 Osmium Dust
- 12 Gold Ingot

NOTE: This list does not include the Redstone you will need to add as a secondary material for use in the Metallurgic Infuser to create Enriched Alloy. You can either:

- A. Add 30 Redstone to the list as a secondary material for use in the Metallurgic Infuser (one Redstone covers one Iron Ingot)
- B. Add 4 Redstone to the list, send them through the Enrichment Chamber, get 4 Compressed Redstone, and use the Compressed Redstone as a secondary material (one Compressed Redstone covers 8 Iron Ingots).

As you can see, Compressed Redstone is much more efficient, but if you don’t have access to an Enrichment Chamber and have a lot of Redstone laying around, it is probably not worth the trouble of making an Enrichment Chamber just for this purpose (although you will absolutely need one later down the line if you plan to progress further in the Mekanism tech tree).

After gathering the materials, craft the ingredients in this order:

1. Create **30 Enriched Alloy** by infusing 30 Iron Ingots with Redstone in the Metallurgic Infuser.
2. Craft **4 Energy Tablets** using the Gold Ingot, Redstone and Enriched Alloy.
3. Craft **12 Solar Panels** using the Glass Pane, Redstone, Enriched Alloy and Osmium Ingot.
4. Craft **4 Solar Generators** using the Solar Panels, Enriched Alloy, Osmium Dust, Energy Tablets and Iron Ingots.
5. Craft the **Advanced Solar Generator** using the Solar Generators, Enriched Alloy and Iron Ingots.

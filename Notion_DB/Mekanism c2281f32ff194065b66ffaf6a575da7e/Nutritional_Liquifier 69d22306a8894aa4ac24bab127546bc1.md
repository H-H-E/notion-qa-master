## Description

The Nutritional Liquifier turns consumable food items into Nutritional Paste when placed into its left UI slot. It can hold a total of 10000mB of paste before it is full and halts production. The nutritional paste is used by the MekaSuit Helmet and the Canteen for feeding the player without having to carry physical individual food items in their inventory.

The canteen is a crafting ingredient in the recipe for the Nutritional Injection Unit module, which can be installed in the MekaSuit Helmet.

**Dusts** are the product of the ore refining system.

The Enrichment Chamber turns ores into dusts and dirty dusts into dusts.

**Dirty dusts** are a product of the ore refining process.

The Crusher turns clumps into dirty dusts. Use the Enrichment Chamber to turn these into useful dusts again.

### Usage

**Sulfur Dust** by itself is not used in much recipes. It can be used as a substitution for Yellow Dye, and be used to create gunpowder using an Enrichment Chamber. However, what makes it such an important ingredient is its ability to produce Sulfur Dioxide in a Chemical Oxidizer.

Sulfur Dioxide can then be used to produce Sulfur Trioxide when used in a Chemical Infuser with Oxygen.

Sulfur Trioxide can then be used to produce Sulfuric Acid when used in a Chemical Infuser with Water Vapor. Sulfuric Acid is a key ingredient that is used in the Ore Processing system and in Fissile Fuel Production. A Chemical Dissolution Chamber requires Sulfuric Acid and ores to produce Dirty Slurries (an ingredient in the 5x ore processing process), and requires Sulfuric Acid and Fluorite to produce Hydrofluoric Acid (an ingredient in the production of Fissile Fuel).

### Obtaining

**Sulfur Dust** can be obtained in many ways:

### Pressurized Reaction Chamber Method

A method is to use the Pressurized Reaction Chamber (PRC) with the ingredients Water; Oxygen; Block of Coal/Charcoal or Coal/Charcoal.

### Coal/Charcoal

Using Coal/Charcoal will require 100mb of Oxygen and Water, and the process will take approximately 5 seconds/100 ticks (with no Speed Upgrades). Doing so will yield 1 **Sulfur Dust** and 100mb of Hydrogen.

### Block of Coal/Charcoal

Using Block of Coal/Charcoal will require 1,000mb of Oxygen and Water, and the process will take approximately 45 seconds /900 ticks, 9x slower than using Coal/Charcoal (with no Speed Upgrades). Doing so will yield 9 **Sulfur Dusts** and 1,000mb of Hydrogen.

### Gunpowder Method

By using Hydrogen Chloride and Gunpowder in a Chemical Injection Chamber, you can produce **Sulfur Dust**. You can obtain gunpowder from flint or a vanilla creeper farm.

### Flint Method

Putting Flint into a Crusher will produce gunpowder, which can then be used in the Gunpowder Method. You can obtain flint from gravel.

### Gravel Method

Putting Gravel into an Enrichment Chamber will produce flint, which can then be used in the Flint method, then the Gunpowder method. You can obtain gravel from cobblestone or digging.

### Cobblestone Generator Method

Putting Cobblestone into a Crusher will produce gravel, which can then be used to in the Gravel Method, then the Flint Method, then the Gunpowder Method. You can obtain cobble stone from a simple cobblestone generator or mining.

**Sawdust** is a byproduct material obtained by processing Wooden objects Precision Sawmill.

Wooden Object | Sawdust Yield Percentage |
— | — |
Log (of any kind) | 25% |
Planks (of any kind) | 25% |
Slab (of any kind) | 13% |
Stairs (of any kind) | 38% |
Stick | 100% |

### Obtaining

**Salt** is a material obtained from mining Salt Blocks. Salt can also be obtained by processing Gaseous Brine through the Chemical Crystallizer.

### Usage

**Salt** can be used to craft back into its originating block (Salt Block) as well as for producing Gaseous Brine in a Chemical Oxidizer. It can also be used to supply a Chemical Injection Chamber with Hydrogen Chloride.

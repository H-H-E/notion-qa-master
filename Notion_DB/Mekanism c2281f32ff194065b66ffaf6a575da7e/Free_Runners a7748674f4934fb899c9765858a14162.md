**Free Runners** are an item that allows players to ascend 1-block inclines automatically (like the Horse), as well as preventing fall damage as long as they are charged. A fall will reduce the item’s charge, depending on how far the fall was.

Free Runners can be charged inside of various power-related generators or storage devices, like the Advanced Solar Generator or the Energy Cube. They can hold a maximum charge of 64.0 kJ.

## Trivia

- The Free Runners may have been inspired from the | Advanced Knee Replacement, from Portal, both in similar design and purpose. (Preventing users from injury caused by falling)
- But they are most likely inspired from the Blade Runners from Satisfactory.

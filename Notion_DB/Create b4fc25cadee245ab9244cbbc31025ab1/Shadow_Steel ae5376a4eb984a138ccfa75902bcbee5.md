**Shadow Steel** is a material used to craft Shadow Casing.

## Obtaining[]

Shadow Steel is created by dropping a Chromatic Compound into the Void. This can easily be done from any island in the End. Once the Chromatic Compound falls into the Void, it will become a Shadow Steel and begin to levitate upwards, allowing you to pick it up. It currently has no use, other than making Shadow Casing.

**Compressed Obsidian** is a compressed version of Refined Obsidian Dust for use as a secondary material in the Metallurgic Infuser. Each piece provides 100 Obsidian, compared to Refined Obsidian Dust which only provides 10 Obsidian.

In both Mekanism v9 and v10, compressed obsidian yields 80 units of obsidian in the Metallurgic Infuser, the same as 8 Refined Obsidian Dust.

It is created by placing Refined Obsidian Dust inside of an Enrichment Chamber.

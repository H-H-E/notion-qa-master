### Interacting[]

To fill an empty bucket with honey, use it on a liquid honey source block. The block is consumed in the process. Flowing honey does not fill a bucket.

### Filling by Spout[]

A Spout can also fill an empty Bucket with honey.

## Usage[]

Using a full honey bucket on a solid block places a honey source block against that block, emptying the bucket.

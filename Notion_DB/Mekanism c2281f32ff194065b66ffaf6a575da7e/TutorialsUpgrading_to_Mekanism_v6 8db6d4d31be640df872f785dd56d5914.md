# TutorialsUpgrading_to_Mekanism_v6

This article is a brief guide to **upgrading an existing Mekanism 7 world from 7.1.2 to 8.1.0**. As of this writing, Mekanism 8.1.0.215 is the latest release, but this process should apply to the current “latest release” as well.

NOTE: This is not a comprehensive administrator’s guide. It assumes that you are already familiar with typical modded-Minecraft tasks like backing up worlds and keeping multiple Minecraft profiles. Upgrading to Mekanism 8 is not complicated, but there are a few steps you will want to take before updating your existing Mek 7 world. If you have any problems during this process, feel free to stop by the Mekanism IRC. (#mekanism on esper.net)

## Will all my data be saved?

Most things will be saved, but because of some internal changes in Mekanism, you will lose items. There is currently no way around this. But don’t panic! You will later replace these with some creative-mode magick after your new Mekanism 8 world is back online.

Here is a quick list of the items that will **NOT** migrate to version 8:

- **Items / Machines :**
    - Free Runners
    - In-world Logistical Transporters *(only affects placed pipes, not pipes in chests or your inventory)*
    - In-world Pressurized Tubes *(only affects placed tubes, not tubes in chests or your inventory)*
    - Some machines may lose their customized input/output confiuration
- **Ores:**
    - Dusts: Copper, Diamond, Lead, Silver, Steel, Sulfur, Tin
    - Dirty Dusts: Lead, Obsidian
    - Clump: Lead, Obsidian
    - Shard: Lead, Obsidian
    - Crystal: Lead, Obsidian
    - Refined Dust: Obsidian
- NOTE: This only applies to the Mekanism version of these items. All other mods’ versions of these items will remain. If you have questions about which version you’re looking at, my advice is to use WAILA.

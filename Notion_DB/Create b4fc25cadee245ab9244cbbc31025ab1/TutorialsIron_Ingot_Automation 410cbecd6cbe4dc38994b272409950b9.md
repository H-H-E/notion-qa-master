# TutorialsIron_Ingot_Automation

Work in progress

Iron can be farmed by grinding cobble and washing the gravel.

Setup;

1. Get a powered millstone or pair of Crushing Wheels.
2. Throw cobble into the crusher.
3. Transfer the crushed gravel onto a Mechanical Belt.
4. Wash the gravel using water and an encased fan. Iron nuggets will occasionally be produced. Keep or void the flint.
5. Using a mechanical mixer, compact the iron nuggets into iron ingots.

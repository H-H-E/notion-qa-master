# Fission_Reactor_Logic_Adapter

**This article is a stub.**
Please help us by expanding it A **Fission Reactor Logic Adapter** is a block used to remotely control a Fission Reactor. With one installed, the user can use various events or conditions to control the reactor automatically with no manual input. This is useful for prevention of meltdowns.

It can be accessed by right-clicking it.

## Usage

The Fission Reactor Logic Adapter is installed in the side of the Fission Reactor, replacing either Fission Reactor Casing or Reactor Glass blocks. The location does not matter, as long as it is placed on a wall and not a corner. The red dot can output or receive a redstone signal depending on the configuration.

## Configuration

There are currently 6 configuration options available to set the Logic Adapter to:

- disabled - disables reaction to redstone signal, essentially turns the block off
- activation - upon receiving a redstone signal the adapter will shut off the reactor
- high temperature - when the temperature of the reactor gets critical a redstone signal is emitted
- excess waste - when the reactor has excess waste a redstone signal is emitted
- damage critical - when damage to the reactor gets to 100% redstone signal is emitted
- insufficient fuel - when there is insufficient fuel to maintain a reaction a redstone signal is emitted

These can be activated by clicking the desired setting. The GUI will display the current mode of the Logic Adapter and the current reactor status at the bottom.

# Getting_started

## Crafting[]

Many of createâ€™s recipes use the following resources:

- Andesite
    - Andesite Alloy
- Iron Ingot
- Zinc Ingot
    - Brass Ingot
- Copper
- Sheets

Sheets can be made with a Mechanical Press.

The first of these materials that the player will obtain will likely be iron, followed by andesite alloy. Copper and Zinc will come later, but Brass will not be found until access to the Nether is granted.

## Power Generation[]

Create uses Rotational Force, which is used to power various kinetic appliances such as the Mechanical Press, Mechanical Mixer, and multiple Contraption anchors. Rotational Force can be generated by Generators such as:

- Hand Crank
    - Used to manually power components.
- Water Wheel
    - A simple generator that can be pushed by a flowing liquid.
- Windmill Bearing
    - A stronger generator that requires 8 Sail type blocks to function. Add more sails to make it stronger.
- Steam Engine
    - A generator that uses water as fuel.

## Contraptions[]

Contraptions are moving structures made of blocks that can be used to serve a variety of purposes. Use Linear Chassis, Radial Chassis, Super Glue, Slime Blocks, or Honey Blocks to attach structures to Contraption anchors such as:

- Mechanical Piston
- Cart Assembler
- Gantry Carriage
- Mechanical Bearing
    - Windmill Bearing
    - Clockwork Bearing
- Rope Pulley

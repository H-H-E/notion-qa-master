## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

### Configuration[]

Using a Wrench, the Cart Assembler can be configured to set the movement of cart contraptions to “Always face toward motion (default,)” “Pause actors while rotating,” and “Lock Rotation.” On the second setting, actors such as a Deployer will not work while the cart rotates. On the third setting, the contraption will not change alignment along with the cart, and will retain the same rotation from when it was built, much like the effect of a Mechanical Bearing on a cart contraption.

As of 0.3.2, Cart Contraptions with Spawners attached can no longer by picked up; and as of 0.5 Cart contraptions with attached Budding Amethysts can no longer be picked up as well, instead displaying the message “a mystical force is binding this cart contraption to the world.” This can be changed in the Config.

Cart contraptions will **not** travel through nether portals.

### Cart Contraptions[]

Cart Contraptions can be taken into the inventory by right clicking them with a Wrench. Excluding entities, this keeps all storage and cart configuration.

Similarly to rotating structures, having a Mechanical Bearing in the structure will cause the attached part to keep the same alignment as the cart moves.

Cart Contraptions with a Furnace Minecart can automatically take Coal as fuel from onboard inventories.

Despite having collision with mobs or items, Cart Contraptions do not collide with blocks unless the appropriate world-interaction block makes the collision.

### Carriage Contraptions[]

Carriage contraptions are moving structures connected directly to two minecarts.

Carriage Contraptions can be made by connecting two Cart Assemblers with minecarts using a structure. This will not work if the two minecarts are linked together by Minecart Coupling.

Carriage contraptions can also be disassembled by right clicking with a Wrench.

Aside from movement, there is no difference between the functions of a Carriage Contraption and a Single Cart Contraption. However, the smoother movement is better for moving mobs or items with only collision.

**Mechanical Pipe** is the fluid pipe for Mekanism logistics. It can be used to connect to any blocks with Fluid Handlers in them.

4 Modes as follows:

1. Push: Pushes held fluid into attached block
2. Pull: Pulls fluid from attached block
3. Normal: Default state
4. None: Disconnects the pipe from attached block.

These can be changed with the Configurator by Shift+Right clicking on the pipe connections.

## In-world upgrading

In Mekanism v9, pipes can be upgraded in-world to higher tiers by right-clicking with the appropriate material - Enriched Alloy to upgrade from Basic to Advanced, Reinforced Alloy to upgrade from Advanced to Elite, and Atomic Alloy to upgrade from Elite to Ultimate. This will upgrade up to eight connected pipes at once, and consumes the alloy. Note that if this is used for less than eight pipes, the alloy is still consumed.

## Rates

Name | Capacity (mB/t) | Pump Rate (mB/t) |
— | — | — |
Basic Mechanical Pipe | 2000 | 250 |
Advanced Mechanical Pipe | 8000 | 1000 |
Elite Mechanical Pipe | 32000 | 8000 |
Ultimate Mechanical Pipe | 128000 | 32000 |

**Chromatic Compound** is a material used to create Shadow Steel and Refined Radiance. It is also used to upgrade the Handheld Blockzapper.

Refined Radiance is created by dropping **Chromatic Compound** into a Beaconâ€™s light beam, or by dropping **Chromatic Compound** on the ground and surrounding it with light sources (which it will absorb). It is also worth noting that once it starts absorbing light and you pick it up, it shows a progress bar that looks the exact same as a durability bar which tells you how much more light is needed to become refined radiance

Shadow Steel is created by dropping a **Chromatic Compound** into the Void.

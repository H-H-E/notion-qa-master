# Solar_Evaporation_Plant

https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Thermal_Evaporation_Plant The Thermal Evaporation Plant is a multiblock structure with the purpose of converting Water to Brine, which can be further converted to Lithium by the use of a second Thermal Evaporation Plant.

## Construction

The structure has a 4 by 4 block base with a height of 3 blocks to a maximum height of 18, where the base is made with only Thermal Evaporation Blocks, and the walls contains a Thermal Evaporation Controller, and at least 2 Thermal Evaporation Valves. The structure has no solid roof, and instead can be capped by removing the 4 top corners of the multiblock with Advanced Solar Generators.

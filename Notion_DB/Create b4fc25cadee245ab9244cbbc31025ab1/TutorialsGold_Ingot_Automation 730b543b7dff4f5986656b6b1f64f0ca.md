# TutorialsGold_Ingot_Automation

This tutorial will help you make an automatic setup for generating Gold Ingots. It is very slow, but can be made faster with more components or higher Rotational Force.

## Items Needed[]

- Lava

- Crushing Wheel (6 are needed, although 4 can be substituted with 2 Millstones.)
- Mechanical Press and a Basin
- Encased Fan
- Shaft
- Mechanical Belt

## Production Steps[]

### Foreword[]

All steps should be connected using some kind of item transportation, such as Mechanical Belts.

### Step 1[]

Setup a Cobblestone generator, with a Mechanical Drill behind the generated cobblestone, and a Chute below the cobble.

### Step 2[]

The cobblestone should then be grinded down to Gravel, using the Crushing Wheels or the Millstone.

### Step 3[]

The gravel should then be grinded down to Sand, using the Crushing Wheels (Millstone cannot be used here!). The by-products are Flint, which can be voided or stored, and Clay Ball, which will be useful in Step 5.

### Step 4[]

The sand should then be washed using the Encased Fan behind some water, which results in more Clay Balls.

### Step 5[]

The clay balls then need to be compacted down to Clay Blocks using a Mechanical Press with a Basin underneath it.

Alternatively, some Mechanical Crafters may be used to automate this task.

### Step 6[]

The clay block then needs to be smelted, becoming Terracotta. For this, the most efficient way would be to Bulk Blast it, as it requires no fuel.

### Step 7[]

The terracotta should then be grinded down to Red Sand, using the Crushing Wheels or the Millstone.

### Step 8[]

Finally, the red sand should then be washed, resulting in some Gold Nuggets. The by-product is a Dead Bush, which can be voided or stored.

### Step 9 (optional)[]

If needed, the gold nuggets can be packed into ingots.

## Increasing the production speed[]

To increase the production speed, steps 1 to 3 can be built many times, funneling their products into a singular step 4 station. As stated, steps 4 to 8 (or 9) have to be built only once. If the setup cannot keep up, step 4 may be built twice or more times, if needed.

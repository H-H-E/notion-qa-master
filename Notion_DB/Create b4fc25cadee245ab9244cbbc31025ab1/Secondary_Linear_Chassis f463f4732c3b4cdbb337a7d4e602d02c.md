## Usage[]

Linear Chassis will automatically connect to adjacent and equally aligned chassis. Slime Balls or Super Glue are needed to connect a column of other blocks to either of their piston-like surfaces. The Slime or Super Glue is not consumed on use. A Wrench can be used to adjust the size of the column by hovering over the side and scrolling. Hold ctrl with a Wrench to adjust all connected Chassis at once.

Secondary Linear Chassis can be used to have adjacent chassis that don’t connect to each other.

Chassis are directional; if something is connected to the blocks in the chassis’ column but not the chassis itself, it won’t move the chassis.

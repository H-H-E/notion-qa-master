## Usage[]

The lamp can be activated with a redstone pulse. They will continue to emit a redstone signal afterwards. If multiple Rose Quartz Lamps are adjacent, activating one lamp will turn off other lamps up to 16 blocks away. They will emit a Redstone Comparator signal depending on how far away the comparator is to the active lamp.

Lamps can also be toggled manually with a Wrench. Using this, multiple adjacent lamps can be on at once.

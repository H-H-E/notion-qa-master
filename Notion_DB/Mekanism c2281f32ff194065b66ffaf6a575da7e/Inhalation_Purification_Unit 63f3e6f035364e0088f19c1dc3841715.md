“Applies a miniature electromagnetic field around the breathing apparatus, preventing selected potion effect types.”

Inhalation Purification Units are modules that can protect the player from selected potion effects including beneficial, neutral, and harmful ones. Using its stored energy, it can nullify the potion effects. The potion may still look like it is in effect (e.g. black hearts and injuring noises when hit with a Potion of Decay), but in actuality the player will not receive any of its effects.

Max unit per helmet: 1

Along with the Induction Casing, the **Induction Port** block makes up the multi-block that is the Induction Matrix, an energy storage structure that can hold a considerable amount of energy.

Each Induction Port can be set as Input or Output. An input port can receive energy but will not output any, and vice versa. The LED light on the port shows which mode it is in: green for input, red for output. Toggle the mode using the Configurator in “Configurate (Energy)” mode; sneak right-click the port to toggle.

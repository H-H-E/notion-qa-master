The Configuration card can be used to copy side configurations from one machine to another machine of the same type. You will be able to copy settings from for example a crusher to a crusher but not from a crusher to a metallurgic infuser.

To save the configuration from a machine, hold shift and right click with the configuration card on the machine with the configuration you want to copy. If you hover over the configuration card in your inventory it will show the type of machine the stored information was retrieved from.

To load a configuration to a machine, right click the machine with the configuration card. This will clear the configuration card so if you need to copy one configuration to several machines you need to save it again by holding shift and right clicking on the machine you just inserted the configuration into.

After loading, the input/output configuration for items/fluids/gases etc should be the same on the two machines.

To craft obsidian tools at least a Enrichment Chamber, a Metallurgic Infuser, a Crusher and a Osmium Compressor are required.

Step 1 : Mine Obsidian Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5 Step 6Step 2 : Put obsidian blocks in Enrichment chamber.(Each blocks will give 2 dirty obsidian dust, wich will results in 2 ingot for 1 block)

Step 3 : Get diamond dust. (Put diamond in Crusher)

Step 4 : Put diamond dust in Metallurgic Infuser.

Step 5 : Put dirty obsidian dust in Metallurgic Infuser.

Step 6 : Take refined obsidian dust and put it in Osmium Compressor.

Now you got Obsidian Ingot. You can craft tools, sword and armor pieces the same recipes than Iron Ingots.

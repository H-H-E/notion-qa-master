A **Heat Generator** converts heat energy into power. This is often the first generator to craft because, although it provides only a small amount of power, **it is the only mekanism generator that does not require steel**. The **Heat Generator** can generate power in both an active and a passive mode simultaneously. Since the **Heat Generator** outputs so little power and it is fairly inexpensive to create, it is common to have two or three generators constantly trickling power into one or more Energy Cubes.

- Active Power

The active mode of generation comes from loading combustible materials into the generator. They will be burned, and the heat will be converted to power at the rate of 2 kJ/s (100 J/t). All active power fuels generate power at the same rate, but higher tier fuels will burn for a longer time, producing more total power. If a lava bucket is fed into the Heat Generator, it will consume the lava, but return the bucket.

- Passive Power

Passive power can be generated by placing the **Heat Generator** adjacent to a lava source or flowing lava. For each side that is next to lava, it will generate 100 J/s (5 J/t per side), giving a maximum of 500 J/s of passive power.

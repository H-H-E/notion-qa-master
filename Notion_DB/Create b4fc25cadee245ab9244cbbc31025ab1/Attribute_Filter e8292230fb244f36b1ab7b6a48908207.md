### Filters[]

Filters can be set to either allow or deny set items and ignore or respect data.

### Nesting[]

Both Filters and Attribute Filters can be put inside Filters, and this can go on infinitely. The original filter takes priority over nested filters; for example, an original filter can Deny Saplings and have a nested filter that allows saplings, but the saplings will still be denied, and vice versa.

### Attribute Filters[]

Attribute filters focus only on data. The filter can Allow items with any of the desired attributes, only allow them if they have all of the desired attributes, or deny items with any of the selected attributes. A reference item is required to show and choose attributes, but attributes can be added by multiple items.

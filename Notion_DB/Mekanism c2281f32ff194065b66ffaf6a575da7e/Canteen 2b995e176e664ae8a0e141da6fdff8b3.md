## Description

The canteen can be filled with Nutritional Paste from the Nutritional Liquifier. It effectively replaces all food in the game, filling the playerâ€™s hunger bar to full from its current position when consumed. This consumes an amount of paste proportional to the number of hunger points filled.

The canteen is a crafting ingredient in the recipe for the Nutritional Injection Unit module, which can be installed in the MekaSuit Helmet.

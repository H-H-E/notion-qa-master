A Wind Turbine’s giant blades harness the force of the wind to generate power. Each Wind Turbine requires a fairly large 1x1x5 area. The machine will generate power day and night, in sun or rain, but the turbine must have a clear view of the sky (over the rotor housing at the top of the tower).

The power output increases linearly with its elevation, to a maximum output of 480 J/t (9.6kJ/s). Connect Universal Cable or other compatible cables to the “front” of the base of the Turbine, the side underneath the blades (indicated by a green square). Right-click with a wrench to rotate the entire machine.

By default, the minimum elevation is 24 and the maximum elevation is 255. (As of Mekanism 9 the “elevation” is calculated using the top block of the turbine.) The minimum generation value is 60 and the maximum is 480. With these default settings, power output scales linearly according to y * 1.8181 + 16.3636, power= (20y+180)÷11. If the turbine is placed above or below the configured maximum or minimum elevation, it will still function, producing the maximum or minimum power value, respectively.

Radial Chassis are used to rotate a cylinder of blocks around them when powered by a Bearing. You can right click on the sides while holding a Slimeball or Super Glue to make them sticky, and again to apply it to all sides. The radius of affected blocks can be changed per chassis with a Wrench. Hold `Ctrl` to scroll every connected chassis.

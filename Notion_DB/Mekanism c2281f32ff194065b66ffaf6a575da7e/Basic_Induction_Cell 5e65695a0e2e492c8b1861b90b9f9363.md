**Induction Cells** are components in the Induction Matrix. Each cell increases the total energy storage of a Matrix. Note that this does not increase transfer rate; look to the Induction Providers for that.

These cells in 4 different tiers: Basic, Advanced, Elite and Ultimate. Each tier has 8x the capacity of it’s former tier, with the exception of the Basic tier.

Upon upgrade from one tier to the next, all energy contained in the induction cells is retained in the crafting result. Upon breaking a Induction Matrix, the energy contained in the structure is divided evenly between its component **Induction Cells**.

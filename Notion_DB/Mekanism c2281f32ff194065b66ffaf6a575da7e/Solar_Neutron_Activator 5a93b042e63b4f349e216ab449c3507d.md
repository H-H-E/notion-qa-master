The **Solar Neutron Activator** is a machine that directs the neutron radiation of the sun into its internal reservoir, allowing for the slow creation of various isotopes.

The input is at the bottom, the output is at the front. It does not need energy except for direct sunlight which can be intercepted by transparent blocks such as glass, cables, pipes, etc.

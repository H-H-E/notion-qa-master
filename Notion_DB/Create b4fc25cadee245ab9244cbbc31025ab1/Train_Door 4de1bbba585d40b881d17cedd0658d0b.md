## Usage[]

Train Doors will automatically open and close when a Contraption stops or starts movement, respectively. On non-player-piloted Trains, the doors will only open when arriving at a Train Station, and close when the Train departs. While piloted by a player, the doors function the same as on other Contraptions, opening and closing when it stops or starts movement.

When two Train Doors are placed together with opposing hinges, they will open and close together.

Like other Doors, sliding doors can be interacted with while on Contraptions.

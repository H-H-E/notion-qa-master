## Usage[]

### Power Generation[]

When attached to a rotating structure on a Windmill Bearing, the Sail will generate power with the same effectiveness as Wool. At least 8 Sails are needed to initiate the rotation.

The Sail does not require Super Glue or a connected Linear or Radial Chassis.

## Dyeing[]

Right clicking on a placed Sail with Dye will dye the Sail. This is the only way to obtain Sail colors other than white. Double clicking applies the dye to each connected Sail. Placed Sails can also be Sheared into Sail Frames.

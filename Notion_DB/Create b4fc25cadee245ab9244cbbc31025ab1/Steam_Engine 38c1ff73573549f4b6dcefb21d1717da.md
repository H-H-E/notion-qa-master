# Steam_Engine

The **Steam Engine** is a block meant to provide Rotational Force, and has the highest Stress capacity compared to the other generating blocks. It converts the pressure caused by heating Water in a tank into kinetic stress, allowing large scale item production and contraptions to enter the realm of possibility.

## Usage[]

Steam Engines can be placed on Fluid Tanks. At least 4 Fluid Tanks and 1 heat source block are required to make a functioning Steam Engine, which uses Water as fuel. A Shaft can be used on the engine to make a kinetic output. Steam Engines generate power based on the heat sources present, amount of water, and size of the boiler; extra Steam Engines will not increase the power generated unless the boiler meets these criteria. All passive heat sources generate the same amount of heat. Higher level boilers consume water faster, so water will need to be input faster.

More power can be generated with the help of Blaze Burners, which produce varying amounts of heat depending on their state. At higher power levels, more Steam Engines are required to extract rotational power from the boiler. Power levels can be inspected by viewing the boiler with the Engineer’s Goggles. The maximum level is 18, producing 294,912 su.

### Display Link[]

The Boiler can be a source for Display Links, outputting a similar display to what is viewable with the engineer’s goggles.

## Trivia[]

- Steam Engines can overstress separately. This means that if one overstresses, the rest will continue to generate stress units. This makes it possible to make a steam engine that never binds up.
- Unlike machines in various other mods, which may use only a small amount of water and store excess for later, a Steam Engine setup does not store water, despite being made of Fluid Tanks. Water is, “evaporated” upon insertion whether it surpasses the requirements of the engine or not, and any liquid stored beforehand in the Fluid Tank is instantly voided.

# Create_Addon

Create Addon is an addon mod that adds new armor and drill.(avibable for 1.16)

From left to right while looking at the picture:

Brass Exoskeleton chestplate | Gain strength II & Slowness II | The weight of the gears causes the chestplate to have a knockback resistance of 10 and an armor value of 12, double that of iron.

Fan-powered brass chestplate | Fans push you faster while in the water. | You fall slowly when crouched while falling. | Gain Highjump II while on the floor.

Brass Drill | A tier between iron and diamond, while using the same harvest level as iron. | The drillâ€™s torque bestows you with efficiency IV, but due to its rudimentary design and weight, you gain poison for its first 20 seconds during its activation period. They should really put some protection guards around those drill bits.

New stuff.

## Usage[]

While held, funnels prevent the player from accessing inventories, instead placing them. Sneak right clicking with a Funnel places it in input mode. Using a Wrench on the funnel switches it between input and output mode. Redstone can be applied to stop the funnel from inputting or outputting. Right-clicking a funnel on a Mechanical Belt causes it to extend one block forward.

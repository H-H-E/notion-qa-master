## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

Mechanical Mixer can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

The Mechanical Mixer is powered by an internal cogwheel, and will behave as one to any adjacent components, relaying and reversing rotation sideways.

The Mixer requires a **minimum rotational speed of 32 RPM** from its power source to work. Mixers will process ingredients faster the more speed it is given.

To work, a Mixer must be placed directly above a Basin, with a 1 block gap. When a valid recipe is inserted by throwing the ingredients in the Mixer, the Mixer will automatically combine the ingredients.

### Automating Shapeless Recipes[]

All shapeless crafting recipes can be made automatically using the Mechanical Mixer by inserting required items into the Basin under the mixer. An example of such recipe is:

### Automating Brewing[]

All Brewing recipes can be made automatically using the Mechanical Mixer by inserting the required items and fluids into the Basin under the mixer. Brewing recipes require heating with a blaze burner.

### Mixing[]

The Mechanical Mixer may be used to perform mixing recipes, which are not possible to make anywhere else. Those recipes include:

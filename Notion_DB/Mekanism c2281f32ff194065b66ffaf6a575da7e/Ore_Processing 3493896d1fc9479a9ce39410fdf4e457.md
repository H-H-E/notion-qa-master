Description Mekanism adds various tiers of ore processing for better ingot yields from Silk Touch Ore. To acquire Silk Touch Ore the silk touch enchant needs to be enchanted on a pickaxe. Each tier use a specific machine to process the raw ore ( for direct ingots, dusts, clumps, shards or crystals ).Then the product is processed by the machines of the previous tiers. | Ore processing flowchart (Mekanism v10) | Simplified version of flowchart | | |

## Tier 0

This is the stock minecraft Tier of directly smelting ores into ingots. First energy is produced for example by Heat Generator in passive mode.

1 Raw Ore → Energized Smelter → 1 Ingot

Basic Tier 0 Setup ## Tier 1

New machines on this tier:

Enrichment Chamber

This tier doubles ingot yield, similar to many other mods. It uses the Enrichment Chamber, similar to Thermal Expansion’s Pulverizer and IC2’s Macerator.

1 Silk Touch Ore → Enrichment Chamber → 2 Dusts → Energized Smelter → 2 Ingots

Basic Tier 1 Setup ## Tier 2

New machines on this tier:

Purification Chamber

Crusher

This tier triples ingot yield, like Thermal Expansion’s Induction Smelter (with rich slag). It uses the Purification Chamber, Crusher and Enrichment Chamber. The Purification Chamber requires a source of Oxygen.

This tier can also double raw ore you may have mined when using a pickaxe without silk touch enchanted on it.

1 Raw Ore (Non Silk Touch harvest) + Oxygen → Purification Chamber → 2 Clumps

2 Clumps → Crusher → 2 Dirty Dusts → Enrichment Chamber → 2 Dusts → Energized Smelter → 2 Ingots

OR

1 Silk Touch Ore + Oxygen → Purification Chamber → 3 Clumps

3 Clumps → Crusher → 3 Dirty Dusts → Enrichment Chamber → 3 Dusts → Energized Smelter → 3 Ingots

Oxygen Can be obtained like so:

Water → Electric Pump → Electrolytic Separator → Oxygen

Hint: You can use Gas-Burning Generator to recycle Hydrogen produced by Electrolytic Separator back to energy. That saves **a lot** of energy.

Basic Tier 2 Setup ## Tier 3

New machines on this tier:

Chemical Injection Chamber

Chemical Infuser

This tier quadruples ingot yield. It uses the Thermal Evaporation Plant, Chemical Injection Chamber, Electrolytic Separator, Chemical Infuser, Purification Chamber, Electrolytic Separator, Crusher and Enrichment Chamber.

1 Silk Touch Ore + Hydrogen Chloride →Chemical Injection Chamber → 4 Shards

4 Shards + Oxygen → Purification Chamber → 4 Clumps

4 Clumps → Crusher → 4 Dirty Dusts → Enrichment Chamber → 4 Dusts → Energized Smelter → 4 Ingots

The chain to make Hydrogen Chloride is self-sustaining but quite involved.

Water → Electric Pump → Thermal Evaporation Plant → Brine → Electrolytic Separator → Sodium and Chlorine

Or

Salt → Chemical Oxidizer → Gaseous Brine → Rotary Condensentrator → Brine → Electrolytic Separator → Sodium and Chlorine

Hydrogen (from water electrolysis) and Chlorine → Chemical Infuser → Hydrogen Chloride

Basic Tier 3 Setup ## Tier 4

New machines on this tier (plus machines used for gas crafting, see the description below).

Chemical Dissolution Chamber

Chemical Washer

Chemical Crystallizer

This tier quintuples ingot yield. It uses the Rotary Condensentrator, Chemical Dissolution Chamber, Chemical Washer, Chemical Crystalizer, Chemical Oxidizer, Solar Evaporation Plant, Chemical Injection Chamber, Electrolytic Separator, Chemical Infuser, Purification Chamber, Electrolytic Separator, Crusher and Enrichment Chamber.

1 Silk Touch Ore + Sulfuric Acid → Chemical Dissolution Chamber → Ore Slurry

Ore Slurry + Water → Chemical Washer → Clean Ore Slurry → Chemical Crystalizer → Crystals

Crystals are then put into a Tier 3 setup to be processed.

You need a chain to make Hydrogen Chloride the same as Tier 3. You also need a source of Gravel/Flint/Gunpowder.

Gunpowder + Hydrogen Chloride → Chemical Injection Chamber → Sulfur

Sulfur → Chemical Oxidizer → Sulfur Dioxide

Sulfur Dioxide + Oxygen → Chemical Infuser → Sulfur Trioxide

Water → Rotary Condensentrator → Water Vapor

Water Vapor + Sulfur Trioxide → Chemical Infuser → Sulfuric Acid

An example of Tier 4 Processing ## Previous versions

Hydrogen Chloride production in Mekanism 6:

Water → Solar Evaporation Plant → Brine → Electrolytic Separator → Hydrogen and Chlorine → Chemical Infuser → Hydrogen Chloride

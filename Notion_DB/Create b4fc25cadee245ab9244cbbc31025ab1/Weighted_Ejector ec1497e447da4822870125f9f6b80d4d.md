## Usage[]

Before placing the ejector, shift right click on a block to target it. The block must be in a straight line from the Ejector. The further away the target is, the longer the Ejector will take to recharge.

The amount of items ejected can be adjusted with a Wrench after the Ejector is fully wound up. The Ejector will wait until it has the appropriate amount of items. The Ejector can also be rotated along with the target block with a wrench.

Items flung still have collision, but cannot be picked up or stopped by the player.

If the Ejector is rotated, the displacement of the target is rotated.

## Usage[]

Seats come in every color of Dye. They function much like a Boat in that they can be ridden by players and mobs. They retain this function while on a Contraption.

Leads can be used to seat mobs more easily. This also applies to seats on assembled Contraptions. Mobs can be removed from their seats by a Deployer or by right clicking the Seat (this will cause the player to sit in the mobâ€™s place.) They can also be removed by other Contraptions passing through the Seat. Players can leave the seat by sneaking.

Placed Seats can be dyed with Dye.

### Trains[]

Main articles: Train and Train Schedule If a player sits in a Seat on a Train and enters third person mode by pressing `F5`, their view will be zoomed out further than normal. The amount can be adjusted in the Config.

If a non-Blaze Burner conductor is desired, a Seat must be placed directly behind the Train Controls.

A Train Schedule can be used to count the amount of players seated on a Train before leaving the Train Station. This can also be displayed with a Display Link.

Sitting in a Seat on a Train will also allow the player to stay on the Train as it passes through Nether Portals.

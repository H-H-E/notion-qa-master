The Paxel, originally inspired by *book’*s Uranium Mod, has gone on to become one of Mekanism’s core features. Created by combining a Pickaxe, Axe, and Shovel of any tool-building resource, it includes a faster harvesting rate for all blocks, as well as a higher amount of uses and the possibility to repair wooden, iron, gold, stone and diamond paxels on a anvil with the concerned materials, but bronze, lapis lazuli, steel, glowstone, osmium and obsidian paxels are not repairable. It also has a damage boost against mobs.

Note : Tools (shovel, axe and pickaxe) must be made of the same material. Iron axe, iron shovel and iron pickaxe will produce a iron paxel.

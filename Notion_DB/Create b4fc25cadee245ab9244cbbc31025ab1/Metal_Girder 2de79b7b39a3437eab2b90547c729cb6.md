## Usage[]

Shafts can be placed inside placed Girders, working similarly to Shafts encased with Casing.

### Placement[]

Girders can be placed normally, as well as with placement assist. Sneak to place them without placement assist. A Wrench can be used to adjust the Girderâ€™s visual connections.

Metal Girders placed alongside Train Track in the off-hand.

Girders can also be paved under Train Tracks if held in the off-hand while placing the Tracks. Doing so with a Track that curves causes the Girders to appear to curve. If the Track is broken, the curved Girders will follow suit. Metal Girders are placed under train tracks very cleanly while holding them in your off-hand.

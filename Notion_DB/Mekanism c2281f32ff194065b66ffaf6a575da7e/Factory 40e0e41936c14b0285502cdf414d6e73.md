# Factory

Factories are advanced forms of the basic machines aimed to assist in large scale resource processing. They come in three tiers: Basic, Advanced, and Elite.

There are factory versions for the:

- Energized Smelter
- Enrichment Chamber
- Crusher
- Osmium Compressor
- Combiner
- Purification Chamber
- Chemical Injection Chamber
- Metallurgic Infuser (added in v9)

A note about power usage: Each subsequent Factory tier increases the power required to use the Factory, based on the number of added slots. So if an Energized Smelter requires 50 Joules per tick, a Basic Smelting Factory will require 150 Joules per tick, an Advanced Smelting Factory 250 Joules per tick, and so on.

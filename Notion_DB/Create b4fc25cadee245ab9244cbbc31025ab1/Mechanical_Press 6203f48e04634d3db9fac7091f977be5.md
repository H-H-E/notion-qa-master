The **Mechanical Press** is a mechanical component that applies Pressing, Packing, and Compacting recipes to items below it. It is an important early-game item, as it is used to press Ingots into Sheets, which are important ingredients for higher-level components.

The Mechanical Press is powered by an internal Shaft, accessed from two opposite sides. Much like Shafts, Presses will relay rotation along their axis. It processes items faster when it receives faster rotational power.

## Obtaining[]

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

### Pressing[]

By default, the Mechanical Press will apply Pressing recipes to items underneath it. This can be set up in two ways:

- When placed one space above any block, it will process all valid items on the block when given rotational power. Items with no pressing recipe are unaffected.
- When placed one space above a Mechanical Belt, it will automatically press incoming items, stalling the belt until each operation is done. Items with no pressing recipe are ignored.

Pressing recipes cannot be applied in bulk.

### Packing[]

When a Mechanical Press is placed above a Basin, it will apply Packing or Compacting recipes to ingredients in the Basin. Packing and Compacting recipes are applied one at a time and cannot be applied in bulk.

Packing recipes are any 2x2 or 3x3 crafting recipe that uses the same item in every slot. Some examples are:

The Mechanical Press will begin packing items as soon as there are enough of the same item.

### Compacting[]

When a Mechanical Press is placed above a Basin, it will apply Packing or Compacting recipes to ingredients in the Basin. Packing and Compacting recipes are applied one at a time and cannot be applied in bulk. Compacting recipes are following:

The Press will automatically process any valid recipe it detects inside the Basin, regardless if there are leftovers inside, as long as the Basin has inventory space remaining.

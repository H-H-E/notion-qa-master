## Usage[]

When connected to a component, the speed of the rotation is shown by a hand on the face of the Speedometer. The higher the hand is, the faster the rotation. By using Engineerâ€™s Goggles, this speed is quantified with a number.

### Redstone[]

A Redstone Comparator can be used to output the absolute value of the speed of the rotation as a redstone signal (Negative RPM gives the same value as positive).

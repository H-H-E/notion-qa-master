## Usage[]

By default, each Item Vault block has a storage space of 20 stacks, and this can be changed in the Config. Items cannot be added or removed by the player, but by components such as Chutes and Funnels.

Item Vaults will connect with other Item Vaults. 1 tall vaults can be up to 3 blocks long, 2x2 tall item vaults can be 6 blocks long, and 3x3 tall vaults can be 9 blocks long, resulting in a **maximum storage space** of 1620 stacks in one Item Vault multiblock.

A Redstone Comparator can be used to show the Vaultâ€™s inventory, outputting a signal strength of 15 when the Vault is full.

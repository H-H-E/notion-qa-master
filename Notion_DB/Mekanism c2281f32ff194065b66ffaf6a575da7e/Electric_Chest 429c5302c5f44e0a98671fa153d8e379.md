The **Electric Chest** (Now **Personal Chest** as of V9) is similar to the vanilla Minecraft chest, but has a number of added benefits:

- When powered, it has the inventory space of a large chest while taking up the space of a single chest
- Also when powered, will allow you to lock it with a password.
- When removed, it will retain its inventory.
- Right-clicking with the Electric Chest in hand will show you its inventory, effectively allowing the player to use it as a backpack.

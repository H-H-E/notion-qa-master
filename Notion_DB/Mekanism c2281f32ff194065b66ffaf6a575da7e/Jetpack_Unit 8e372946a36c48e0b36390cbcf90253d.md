“Applies a hydrogen-fueled jetpack to the MekaSuit.”

Jetpack Units are modules that allows your MekaSuit Bodyarmor to have the functions of a Jetpack. Once applied, the MekaSuit Bodyarmor will have an internal storage for hydrogen (48,000mb). The Jetpack Unit is best paired with the Electrolytic Breathing Unit. Doing so allows the accumulation of hydrogen when underwater or in the rain. Alternatively, hydrogen can manually be refueled using a chemical tank filled with hydrogen.

Max unit per bodyarmor: 1

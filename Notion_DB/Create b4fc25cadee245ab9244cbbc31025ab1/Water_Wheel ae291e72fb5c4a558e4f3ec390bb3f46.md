The **Water Wheel** is a source of rotational power. It generates Rotational Force when water flows over it.

Due to the fact that the materials required to craft it are easily accessible in the early-game, the Water Wheel serves as the earliest generator that can be made.

Total stress capacity can be increased by adding more wheels in sequence.

## Usage[]

When water flows over a Water Wheel, it will begin to rotate. This rotational power can be conveyed to other Components from the Water Wheelsâ€™ Shaft.

The more sides of the wheel the water covers, the faster the wheel will rotate and the more Stress capacity it will provide. Only flowing water or source blocks with bubble columns counts toward the power generation.

The water wheel has a correct direction of rotation, shown by how the blades are oriented. Water flowing the wrong way around the wheel causes it to produce less rotational speed and stress capacity than if the water was flowing the right way. Having water flowing in the opposite directions might slow down the rotational speed or even stop it. The direction of rotation is counter-clockwise when placed standing, or clockwise when crouching.

Note that Soul Sand bubble columns can also be used to increase the speed.

The maximum SU can also be achieved in a horizontal water wheel without Soul Sand by making a single water source block flow around the wheel.

Lava can be used as well, but this is not recommended as it produces less power and is quite dangerous, and as such does not comply with OSHA standards.

To maximize the output from a Water Wheel (320 SU), have water flowing in the right direction around as much of the wheel as possible, like vertically or horizontally.

Water wheels can be placed side-by-side to add together their stress capacities.

Water wheels can also be powered by Lava and Chocolate and will grant advancements upon doing so.

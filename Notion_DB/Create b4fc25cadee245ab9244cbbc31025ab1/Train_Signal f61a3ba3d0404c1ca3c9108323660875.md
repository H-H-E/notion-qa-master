## Usage[]

Right-click a Train Track, then place the signal nearby.

Conductors will never cross a Train Signal from the opposite direction. A Train Signal can be made two-way by having two Train Signals linked to the same place.

Train Signals divide the track network into segments. The segments can be viewed by holding a Signal while looking at the Track. Conductors will not enter a track segment occupied by another Train, regardless of how large the Train or the segment is. Use a Wrench on the signal to activate a different mode. This mode will stop the train before the denoted segment if the segment afterward is occupied.

Nixie Tubes can be attached to make the signal more visible. Signals can be forced red by being activated with Redstone. They will also give a Redstone Comparator signal while red.

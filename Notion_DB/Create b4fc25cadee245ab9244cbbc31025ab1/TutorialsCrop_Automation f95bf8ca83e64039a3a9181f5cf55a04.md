# TutorialsCrop_Automation

Work in progress

The Create mod can be used to automatically farm crops and replant them.

This design is scaleable. Therefore, you could use 12 linear chassis instead of 5. Just keep in mind that you need the same number of harvesters as chassis.

For this build, you will need:

- A source of Rotational Force
- A Mechanical Bearing
- A Radial Chassis
- 5 Linear Chassis
- 5 Mechanical Harvesters
- 1 Chest
- 2 Portable Storage Interfaces

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

The Cuckoo Clock is powered by connecting a Shaft, or other rotational component, to the back of the clock.

The Cuckoo Clock can run at any rotational speed, and produces stress equivalent to itâ€™s speed.

Besides showing the in-game time, the Cuckoo Clock also chimes twice daily, once at noon, and once dusk (as soon as players can sleep). At noon a small pig pops in and out of the clock 3 times and makes an oinking sounds, at dusk a small creeper pops in and out of the clock 3 times and makes hissing sounds.

### Display Link[]

Display Links can read information from Cuckoo Clocks. There are two options:

- Time of Day (12 hour or 24 hour)
- Stopwatch - If the link is paused with Redstone, the time will reset upon being activated again.

### Mysterious Cuckoo Clock[]

The Mysterious Cuckoo Clock is an easter egg. Power it and wait until noon or dusk.

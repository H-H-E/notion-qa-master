## Production

Ethylene (Ethene) is a Gas produced by processing Bio Fuel in a Pressurized Reaction Chamber (PRC). 2 Bio Fuel and 100 millibuckets (mB) of hydrogen in a PRC will generate 100 mB of Ethylene and a single Substrate.

## Usage

Ethylene is a potent, long-lasting energy source. When burned in a Gas-Burning Generator 1000mB of ethylene will produce a total of 28.2 MJ (11.28 MRF) of power at between 705 J/t (282 RF/t) and 19.74 kJ/t (7896 RF/t), depending on the Gas-Burning Generator Burn Rate.

## Example Setup

Energy Production Setup Use your prefered source of Bio-Fuel (i.e. Rotten Flesh, Seeds, Wheat) that is processed by a Crusher and Hydrogen from an Electrolytic Separator to produce Ethylene. Then burn it in a Gas-Burning Generator.

## Outdated Information

One Electrolytic Separator produces just enough Hydrogen for a 3x Speed PRC. For feeding this you need a 5x Speed Crusher with a constant supply of Bio-Fuel ingredients. The amount of Ethylene produced is enough for approx. 70 Generators which equals 21000 RF/t. Be aware, that the Ultimate Universal Cable can only cope with 12800 RF/t.

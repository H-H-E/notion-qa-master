## Usage[]

### Placement[]

Fluid Pipes can be adjacent without connecting if they have been made transparent with a Wrench, are encased with Copper Casing, or have a Wooden or Metal Bracket.

Unlike Brackets or windowed pipes, Copper Casing can be placed on Fluid Pipe corners, locking the pipe in place and preventing it from connecting to more adjacent pipes.

### Transferring Fluids[]

Fluid Pipes require Fluid Pumps to move liquid. Fluid Pumps have a maximum range of 16 blocks on either side, adjustable in the Config. If Fluid Pumps are not pumping directly out of a container, the fluid transfer rate is halved.

Fluid Pipes can only move one liquid at a time; if different liquids intersect, the pipe will clog.

Smart Pipes can allow only a certain liquid to pass through them.

Fluid Valves can be given Rotational power to toggle a flow.

### Fluid Distribution and Rates[]

Fluid Pumps at a higher rotational speed will transfer fluids faster. Fluid Pumps on the same network can combine their throughputs. When first starting up a pipe network, fluids take a few moments to propagate to each point before beginning to transfer fluid between containers; this is also dependent on pump speed. This can be witnessed through windowed pipes. However, the pipes themselves do not store fluids.

When pipes split in two or more directions, fluid will be distributed equally between containers so long as the initial fluid propagation is also equal. Fluid transfer and propagation rate will also be divided by the amount of splits.

### Open Ended Pipes[]

Pipes can pick up or place fluid source blocks. When outputting a fluid into air, the pipe will leak, spraying the fluid out in front of it. If possible, a fluid source block will be placed in the world after the pipe outputs 1000mB of fluid.

Certain leaked fluids have effects.

- Water - Puts out fires and extinguishes entities on fire.
- Lava - Deals fire damage and sets entities on fire.
- Milk - Removes status effects.
- Potion - Applies the potionâ€™s effect.

- 0.5: Fluid Pump and Fluid Valve recipes changed.
- 0.4:
    - Fluid Pipe recipe returns 4 fluid pipes instead of 8. Uses vanilla copper.
    - Fluid networks can extract Lava and Water from Cauldrons.
- 0.3: Introduced.

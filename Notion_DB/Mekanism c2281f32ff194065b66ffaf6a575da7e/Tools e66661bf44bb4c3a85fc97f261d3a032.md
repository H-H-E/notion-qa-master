- *Durability*: Durability of tools made with this material (not including the Paxel, which generally has a bonus of 25-35% more durability).
- *Speed*: Measured in ranks relative to the lowest (hand/wooden) and highest (Obsidian) tiers of tools. Note that Paxels have a speed boost.
- *Damage*: Damage dealt using a Sword made of this material.
- *Harvest Level*: What blocks can be harvested with a tool made with this material.

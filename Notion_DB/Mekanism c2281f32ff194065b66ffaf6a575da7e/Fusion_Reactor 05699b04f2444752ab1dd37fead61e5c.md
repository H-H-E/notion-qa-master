# Fusion_Reactor

Fusion Reactor The **Fusion Reactor** is a multiblock structure that allows for variable input rates of 3 types of fuel: Deuterium, Tritium and D-T Fuel. By water cooling the structure, steam can be produced alongside power, which is useful for powering an Industrial Turbine.

## Construction

Step | Image | Description |
— | — | — |
Step 1 | | A star made out of Reactor Frame |
Step 2 | | A square without corners, also made out of Frame. The centers of the sides can be Reactor Ports. |
Step 3 | | A complete square of Reactor Frame but with

Reactor Ports for input/output and a Laser Focus Matrix for the laser. The corners cannot be ports. | | Step 4 | | Same as step 2 | | Step 5 | | Same as Level 1 but with one Reactor Controller in the middle |

## GUI

You access the GUI of the Fusion Reactor by right-clicking the reactor’s Reactor Controller.

### Main Screen

Reactor Controller GUI The text on the main screen of the GUI indicates if the structure is correctly formed or incomplete. This screen also has a single inventory slot, into which you will need to insert a charged Hohlraum in order for lasers to be able to ignite the reaction.

### Heat Tab

The Heat tab of the Controller GUI The two indicators to the left show the temperature of the plasma and the case. The highest of the three on the right shows the internal energy storage and the ones beneath shows the amount of water and steam inside the reactor.

### Fuel Tab

The Fuel tab of the Controller GUI The Fuel tab indicates the amount of fuel and the injection rate. The tanks show, from left to right, the amount of Deuterium, D-T Fuel and Tritium inside. Deuterium and Tritium consumption is equal to injection rate halved, per tick.

### Statistics Tab

The Statistics tab of the Controller GUI The Statistics gives the user various technical information regarding injection rate, max temp, passive generation and steam production.

## Starting the Reaction

The Fusion Reactor will not start on its own. It requires an outside burst of energy from a charged Laser Amplifier and a small amount of D-T Fuel to begin the fusion process. Once the reaction is jump started, it will begin consuming supplied Deuterium and Tritium, creating plasma and generating power. Alternatively you can use a Resistive Heater heating the reactor to 100.00MK Plasma temperature. This can be done quickest at 10MFE/t usage on the heater

### Initial Fuel

The Hohlraum stores 10 units of D-T Fuel required for the initial reaction. To fill it up, place it into a Chemical Infuser which is combining Deuterium and Tritium. Place the Hohlraum into the Reactor Controller when it contains the required D-T Fuel.

### Ignition

The statistics tab details the required ignition temperature for the reaction to begin. To reach this temperature, a Laser Amplifier must be charged with energy from several Lasers feeding into it, and fired into the Laser Focus Matrix. The energy required to start the reaction it requires 400MFE. It must be injected in one big burst to prevent temperature from dissipating, so adding Redstone sensitivity or increasing the minimum energy required by the Amplifier will prevent it from firing prematurely.

With the Hohlraum in the Reactor Controller and enough energy stored in the Amplifier, fire the laser to begin the fusion reaction. If a high enough temperature was achieved, you should immediately see and hear the reactor running. To sustain the reaction, the temperature must not drop below the ignition temperature. Make sure the injection rate is high enough and fuel is constantly being supplied.

## Tips

To keep the reactor running at a constant rate, it is best to pipe in Deuterium and Tritium separately at a rate greater than half of the specified injection rate in the fuel tab for each type of fuel. Piping in D-T fuel will result in the reactor using it all up to an 1000mB/t rate, or a 500mB/t rate of both Deuterium and Tritium

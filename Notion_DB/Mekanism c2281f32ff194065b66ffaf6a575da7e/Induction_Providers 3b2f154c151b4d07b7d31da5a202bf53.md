# Induction_Providers

The **Induction Providers** come come in 4 tiers. Basic, Advanced, Elite and Ultimate.

The **Induction Providers** are used in the Induction Matrix to determine how fast it is able to output energy through the Induction Port.

Using multiple **Induction Providers** in the same Induction Matrix will add extra output capacity, by adding their values together.

The total output value is for the entire multi-block structure, and *not* on a “per port” basis.

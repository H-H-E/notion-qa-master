## Usage[]

Gantry Carriages are a Contraption that will collide with unmovable blocks in their path.

Place Gantry Shafts along where the **Gantry Carriage** will move. Apply Rotational power to the shafts to move the Carriage along them, and invert the power to move it back. Inverting the placement of the shafts will invert all movement. Use a Wrench to help change the orientation.

Apply a Redstone signal to the shaft to stop the carriage and send rotational power through the Carriage’s output. This can be used to move another attached Gantry Carriage.

Gantry Shafts attached to the Carriage’s output will move along with them automatically.

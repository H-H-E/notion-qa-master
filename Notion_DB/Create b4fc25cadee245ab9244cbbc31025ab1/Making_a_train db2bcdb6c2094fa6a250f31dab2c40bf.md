**Making a train**

Start by making a straight track up to 256 blocks long then right click a track with a train station and place it nearby. open its gui and click the make new train button and some of the tracks will have blue dust on them. right click one of the blue tracks to create a Bogey. Bogeys are the pivot points of trains. and you will need 2 of these linked together to make a carriage. if you try to link 3 or more bogeys the train will not assemble. you have to put a forward facing Train Controls on the front carriage for it to assemble. you should put a Seat in front of it. seats should also be used as much as possible because contraptions are entities and you can fall through/out of them.

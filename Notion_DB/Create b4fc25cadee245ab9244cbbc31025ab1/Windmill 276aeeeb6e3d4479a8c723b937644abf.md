## Usage[]

Any block can be attached to the front of the Windmill Bearing, but only Wool, Sails, or Sail Frames will produce power. The wool or sail can be placed in any configuration and shape does not matter. Like other Contraptions, Super Glue or Linear or Radial Chassis are needed to connect the blocks. Sails will connect to each other and blocks that have already been attached with no extra help.

Right-click the windmill bearing with an empty hand to start the windmill. If you want to stop it to change the attached blocks, simply right-click on the block with an empty hand again. Scrolling the mousewheel while holding a Wrench can be used to change the spin direction of the windmill.

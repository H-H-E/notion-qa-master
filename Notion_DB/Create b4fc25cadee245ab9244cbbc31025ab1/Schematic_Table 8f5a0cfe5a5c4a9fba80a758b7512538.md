## Obtaining[]

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

Schematics can be used in the Schematicannon or Deployers. Before use, a Schematic’s coordinates must be selected by right clicking and adjusting the position with the controls on screen. Shift right click to open an interface for entering exact Coordinates.

### Making a Selection[]

Right click two blocks with the Schematic And Quill to select the area to be copied to the schematic. Right click again to name, save, and/or upload the schematic.

Saving the Schematic uploads it to the schematics file, allowing the Schematic And Quill to be used again. Save and Upload makes the Schematic And Quill usable in a Schematicannon or Deployer without the need of a Schematic Table.

Shift right click to remove the selection. Hold ctrl to highlight a block in midair and Scroll to adjust the distance. Once two blocks are selected, look at the selection’s faces and ctrl-scroll to adjust the size.

### Creating a Schematic[]

If a Schematic is saved, it can be copied onto an Empty Schematic with a Schematic Table. This can be done across worlds.

“Evenly distributes charge throughout all worn MekaSuit armor.”

Charge Distribution Units are modules that distributes gained energy evenly to all MekaSuit armor pieces. Normally if you have installed Solar Recharging Units onto your MekaSuit Helmet, only the helmet will gain all the energy it’s producing. With the Charge Distribution Unit installed, the produced energy will be evenly distributed throughout all MekaSuit armor pieces.

Max unit per bodyarmor: 1

Bronze is a durable material created by fusing Tin Dust and Copper Ingot together in a Metallurgic Infuser. It’s not as durable as iron but it’s stronger than stone/leather materials.

## Smelting

Place Tin Dust in the far left slot of a Metallurgic Infuser and place Copper in the middle-left slot. Power the infuser and it will then begin to smelt a bronze ingot.

(Requires 1 tin dust, and 3 copper ingots to make 4 bronze ingots)

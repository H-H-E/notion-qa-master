### Placement[]

The Plough can only be placed on the horizontal face of a solid block, however, this block is not necessary to support the Plough after it is placed.

### Breaking Blocks[]

While attached to a Contraption, the Mechanical Plough will break non-collidable blocks it comes in contact with (ex. snow layers). The Mechanical Plough will also move or launch entities and till soil blocks.

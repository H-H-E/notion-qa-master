# TutorialsTree_Automation

Trees can be cut down using the Mechanical Saw, and Saplings can be placed using the Deployer. This tutorial doesn’t cover the farming of Dark Oak trees.

## Setup[]

```
The Setup for farming 1x1 trees.
```

1. Clear a circular area of desired size where the trees are going to grow. Remember about the sides, as different trees require different space around them.
2. Place a Mechanical Bearing in the middle 1 block above the ground, with the sticky side facing down. This should resemble the radius of the circle.
3. Attach a row of Linear Chassis to the bearing. The stickable side should be facing outwards.
4. Attach 2 Mechanical Saws to the outer end of the Chassis (on the non-stickable side), facing in the direction of rotation of the bearing. Use Super Glue to stick them on.
5. Attach a Deployer to the outer end of the Chassis structure, on the opposite side of the Saws, 1 block from the end of the Chassis, facing towards the end.
6. Put a Filter or a single Sapling in the Deployer’s filter slot.
7. Place a Chest anywhere on the Chassis, using Super Glue.
8. Attach a Portable Storage Interface on the end of the Chassis, on the top side, facing outwards. Use Super Glue to stick it on.
9. Choose the location of the storage, and put a second interface there, 1 block apart. The two interfaces will connect when the whole structure will be passing by the stationary interface.
10. Attach a Smart Chute to the stationary Storage Interface. You can also use other means of item transportation, such as a Hopper or Funnel.
11. Provide some saplings to the Chest. The Deployer will take and place them when the machine is started.
12. Provide Rotation Force to the upper side of the Mechanical Bearing. The machine will start rotating.
13. If the structure is rotating in the wrong direction, place a Gearshift above the bearing and power it with a lever.
14. If you want to have a way of stopping the structure, do the following:
    1. Using a Wrench, set the Movement Mode of the bearing to “Only Place when Anchor Destroyed” (the 3rd option).
    2. Place a Clutch above the bearing or the gearshift, if used.
    3. Place a lever on the clutch. Powering it will stop the rotation, but the parts of the machine will not be placed, preventing the saplings from being destroyed.

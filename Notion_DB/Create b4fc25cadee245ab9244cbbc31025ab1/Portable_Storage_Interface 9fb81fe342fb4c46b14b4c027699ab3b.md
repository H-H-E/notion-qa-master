Portable Storage Interfaces are used on Contraptions.

For Portable Storage Interfaces to interact they must face each other at 1 to 2 blocks apart. One interface must be on a Contraption, while the other is stationary.

The Contraption must have an inventory such as a Chest or Barrel, while the stationary interface has something inserting or extracting directly from it, such as a Funnel, Chute, or Hopper. Inventory will then be exchanged at the rate of the inserting or extracting component.

Contraptions will stall when interfaces meet. A Redstone signal can be applied to break off the connection.

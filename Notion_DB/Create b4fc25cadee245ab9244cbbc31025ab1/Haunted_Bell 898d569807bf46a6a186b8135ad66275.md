## Obtaining[]

### Mysterious Conversion[]

Placing a Peculiar Bell above a Soul Fire will transform it into a Haunted Bell.

### Bulk Haunting[]

## Usage[]

When the Bell is rung (right-click), it will create soul fire particles in spaces where hostile mobs can spawn in a large radius around itself. The Bell ignores daylight, allowing the player to see where mobs can spawn even during the day. It can also be held in the main or offhand to continuously highlight spawnable spaces around the player, albeit in a smaller radius.

Haunted bells can also be used on Contraptions to highlight mob spawn-able points every time they toll.

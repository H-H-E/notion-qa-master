## Usage[]

### Placement[]

The interface of a display link with a Target as a source and a Lectern as an output.

Use the display link on a block to link it, and then place it on the block that will be read from. Though it will link to any block, not every block can act as a display or source. The Link can be paused with a Redstone signal.

Display links have a range of 64 blocks by default (Configurable.)

### Interface[]

Right click the link to access its interface. Additional labels can be added to the output text through this interface. Some sources provide multiple options for formatting the text.

### Display Blocks[]

Blocks the Display Link can write to.

- Nixie Tube
- Display Board
- Sign
- Lectern

### Source Blocks[]

Blocks the Display Link can read from.

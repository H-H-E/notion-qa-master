# Kinetic_Stress

Here is a small demo set up, showing stress using the Engineer’s Goggles

**Stress**, measured in Stress Units (**SU**), is the amount of force being exerted against the force applied. For every machine you add to a system, more force is taken from a network. The amount of SU available can be increased by adding a water wheel, windmill, or other forms of rotation to the network. When the amount of SU goes below zero, the entire network shuts down, as it becomes **Overstressed**. Stress can be displayed using a Stressometer or Engineer’s Goggles. The first time a system gets overstressed the player who caused it to be overstressed will be granted the “overstressed” achievement.

The whole mechanic of stress can be disabled in the config.

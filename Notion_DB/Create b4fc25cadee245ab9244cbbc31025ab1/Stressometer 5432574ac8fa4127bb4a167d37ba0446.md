## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

When connected to a component, the amount of stress in the system versus the stress capacity is shown by a hand on the face of the Stressometer. The higher the hand is, the more stress there is in the system. It can also output a Redstone Comparator signal, outputting at a strength of 15 when the system is overstressed. You can get more precise information such as current and max stress by using Engineer’s Goggles.

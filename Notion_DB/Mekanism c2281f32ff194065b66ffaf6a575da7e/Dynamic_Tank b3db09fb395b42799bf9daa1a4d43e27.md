Along with the Dynamic Glass (pre V9) and Dynamic Valve, **Dynamic Tank** makes up the multi-block that is the Dynamic Tank, a fluid storage structure that can hold a large amount of a single type of fluid, like Railcraft Tanks. However, Dynamic Tanks can be made in any shape, unlike Railcraft Tanks, which must have a square base. In this regard they are similar to Xycraft Tanks. The minimum size is 3x3x3, and the maximum size is 18x18x18. Every block making up the tank as well as every block encased by it gives 16,000 mB of capacity (for instance, the minimum size tank, with a volume of 27 blocks, has a capacity of 432,000 mB). A valid Dynamic Tank structure will flash with “active redstone” particles upon completion.

## Configuration

- All of the Dynamic Tank multiblock’s borders must be made out of Dynamic Tank.
- Dynamic Valve blocks must be placed facing the void within the tank (so it can access the liquid). They CANNOT be placed on any of the borders.
- As mentioned above:
    - Minimum Size=3x3x3
    - Maximum Size=18x18x18
- The tank’s length, width, and height can be any number within these size limits.

### Changing Rotation Axis[]

The Encased Chain Drive can connect to other drives either vertically or horizontally. If a connected chain drive is facing a different way, rotation will be relayed in that direction.

### Changing Rotation Speed[]

Encased Chain Drives can also be connected to Adjustable Chain Gearshifts, which can change the speed based on the redstone power input.

## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

The Stockpile Switch detects how full an inventory is. This is shown as a chest icon on one of the red bars in the interface.

### Placement[]

When placed by the player, the Stockpile Switch will attempt to orient itself toward an adjacent inventory. If multiple or no inventories are present, the Stockpile Switch may orient itself toward the player and can be adjusted as normal using the Wrench. At present, it cannot be oriented vertically.

### Threshold[]

The interface of the Stockpile Switch with default settings. The chest icon is at 50%

Item thresholds can be set to determine when the redstone signal turns on or off. When the Switch is first placed, it stays **off** until it reaches 75% inventory, then stays **on** until it reaches 25% inventory.

The chest icon represents how full the inventory is, as well as the current signal state (on/off) depending on which lane the chest icon is in. The arrows represent inventory thresholds, illustrated by the chest icon switching lanes upon reaching the arrow.

The signal can be inverted by clicking the button showing two opposing arrows next to the lower threshold bar.

### Filtering[]

The switch has an inbuilt filter. The switch can be set to only count how much inventory the filtered items take up while ignoring every other item in the inventory. When a Filter is applied, the switch counts every item in the Filter while ignoring everything else.

## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

### Transferring Items[]

Chutes can insert or extract from inventories above or below them.

Connected chutes will pass items along, similarly to a Mechanical Belt. Chutes can be connected to other chutes diagonally.

To pull items up, an appropriately powered Encased Fan is needed on top of or under the chutes. The speed of the Encased Fan can change how fast items go upwards.

Chutes can be right clicked with a Wrench to be given windows.

### Smart Chutes[]

Smart Chutes behave similarly to Brass Funnels. They can be filtered to only extract certain items, and be stopped with a redstone signal. Unlike funnels, they can insert and extract at the same time, but can only function vertically.

When below a container, stack size can be specified in the filter. Otherwise, only the item type can be specified.

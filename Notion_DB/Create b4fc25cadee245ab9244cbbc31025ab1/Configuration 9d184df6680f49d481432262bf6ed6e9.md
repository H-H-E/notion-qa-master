# Configuration

Create mod has multiple config options that can be used to adjust the Create experience. These settings can be changed in-game at any time through the pause or title screen menu.

They are also located in 3 folders: create-client.toml, create-common.toml, and create-server.toml. Keep in mind the server file is located in each world save rather than in the config folder.

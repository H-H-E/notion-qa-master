## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

Previously-placed controller rails can be broken with bare hands or any tool, dropping themselves as items.

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

## Usage[]

When a Redstone signal is applied, the rail will move carts depending on the strength of the signal. An Analog Lever is helpful for this.

A Controller Rail will propagate it’s signal to other connected Controller Rails up to 8 blocks away.

Powering two rails with different strengths will cause rails between them to interpolate the signal.

## Usage[]

The Nozzle can only be placed on the face of an Encased Fan. It spreads the effect of the fan with a radius of 1 block less than the fanâ€™s normal range, excluding the area behind the fan.

It is helpful to remember that Sneaking negates the effects of the wind, allowing the player to approach the Nozzle without being behind it.

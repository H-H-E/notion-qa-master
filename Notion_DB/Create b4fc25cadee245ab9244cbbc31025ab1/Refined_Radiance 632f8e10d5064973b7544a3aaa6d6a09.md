**Refined Radiance** is a material used to craft the Wand Of Symmetry.

## Obtaining[]

Refined Radiance is created by dropping Chromatic Compound into a Beaconâ€™s light beam, or by dropping Chromatic Compound on the ground and surrounding it with light sources (which it will absorb). After the conversion is completed, Refined Radiance will start levitating upwards, so make sure there is a roof to catch it with. Additionally, when dropped, Refined Radiance will levitate, so be careful not to drop it accidentally.

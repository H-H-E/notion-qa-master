The **Chemical Crystallizer** turns Clean Slurry into Crystals, Lithium into Lithium Dust and Antimatter into Antimatter Pellet. This is one of the select many machines in Mekanism to have dedicated, unchangeable sides, for input and output, with the exception of Item’s config sides.

Input is gas (uses Pressurized Tube) and output is items (uses Logistical Transporter)

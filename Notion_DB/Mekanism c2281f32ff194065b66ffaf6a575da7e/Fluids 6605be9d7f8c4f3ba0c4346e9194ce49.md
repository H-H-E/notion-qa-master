# Fluids

Fluids are a state that many different kinds of chemicals can be in. These liquids can be stored in buckets, Fluid Tanks, and Dynamic Tanks. They can also be poured out and behave like water. Fluid versions of chemicals can usually be made using the Rotary Condensentrator, which turns Gases into Fluids and vice-versa. The Electric Pump can suck up Fluids using electricity for them to be transported in Mechanical Pipes. The Fluidic Plenisher is the opposite of this, dumping out Fluids that are pumped into it.

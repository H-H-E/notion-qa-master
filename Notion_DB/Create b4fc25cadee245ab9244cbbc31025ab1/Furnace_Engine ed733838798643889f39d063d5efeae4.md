The **Furnace Engine** was a Stress-generating block used to create Rotational Force when connected to any Furnace currently going through the process of smelting. As of Version 0.5 of the Create Mod, this block has been retired, and can no longer be obtained in any way.

## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Mechanical Crafting[]

The Furnace Engine was not craftable in a Crafting table, and instead was made through the use of Mechanical Crafters.

## Usage[]

### Power Generation[]

The Furnace Engine used to be the most powerful source of Stress, until it was removed in update 0.5 and was replaced by the Steam Engine. In order to generate power, it was required to be connected to a Furnace, Smoker, or Blast Furnace, as well as a Flywheel. The Furnace Engine needed to be in direct contact with the selected variant of Furnace, as well as have a one-block wide gap between itself and the Flywheel in order to begin producing stress. Using a Blast Furnace would have doubled the efficiency of the engine at the cost of fuel and limiting the variety of items that could be used to start the engine. The engine would continue to produce power until it ran out of fuel and the furnace had stopped burning, slowing to a halt.

Place coal in the bottom slot of the furnace and a combustible material such as logs in the top.

## Trivia[]

- Curiously, though the Furnace Engine was removed, the Flywheel was not. It has been kept into the later versions of the Create mod as a decorative block.
- The Furnace Engine never checked for whether or not an item was actually being smelted, only if the Furnace or any of its variants were active. This allowed for the creation of designs such as the, "*Recycled Item Perpetuation of the Flywheel"* or R.I.P.O.F. generator by YouTube media creator Frendigo, where the furnace would constantly cycle one item in its input slot and start the furnace without ever smelting the item. A video demonstrating this can be found here.

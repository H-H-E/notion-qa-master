# Randomizer

## Introduction[]

**Randomizer** is mechanism that dispenses different levels of signal randomly. Even though various variants of redstone randomizers existed, most of them had defects with compactness and regulation. Using Create modification, these defects can be fixed and modified as player wishes. So this page will help you construct your randomizer using simple components.

This is how working 3-output randomizer must look like. Golden blocks mean outputs of random signals.

Process of constructing is divided by steps for comfortable reading. Screenshots are provided.

Also should be noted that this is 3-output randomizer, which can be modernized up to 4-output one.

## Construction[]

Step 1

**Step 1:** Create a small platform 5x5 or 7x7 scale. Also you need 4 blocks high free space.

Step 2

**Step 2:** Put three blocks, put dropper on top and hopper forward it. *Note: hopper must be set straight down.*

Step 3

**Step 3:** Connect brass funnels to dropper and vanilla hopper. Take attention to the arrows on them: funnel with dropper must be set as *taking in*, funnel with vanila hopper must be set as *extracting*.

Step 4

**Step 4:** Connect vanilla hoppers to chutes that lead to dropper as shown in screenshot. The same must be done on the other side.

Step 5

**Step 5:** Place encased fan facing into the chute and place underneath creative motor (if in Creative mode) or any other regulable source of rotational force for it to push items into the funnel. The same must be done on the other side.

Step 6

**Step 6:** This step requires two different 64(16)-stackable items and one non-stackable item. Here we will use ***wool***, ***wooden axe*** and ***snowball***. Put snowball into the brass funnel filters on the side and change droppable items number into 1, using mousewheel.

Take filter (andesite or brass one) and add wooden axe and wool into white-list. Put them on the other side of randomizer and also put droppable items number as 1.

Step 7: setting the filter

**Step 7:** Since the main part is done, we have to make it into random signals. Put redstone comparators in front of vanilla hoppers; put block just forward the comparator ***that will detect wool and wooden axe***. The snowball one can generate signal all by itself and we`re not going to touch it.

Step 7: filters are already put

Step 8

**Step 8:** Make redstone contraption as shown on screenshot.

Andâ€¦ we`ve finished! The only thing you have to do now is to put wool, axe and snowball into the dropper and check the working. If something is wrong, please re-check your randomizer on mistakes.

*P.S.* If you need unequal chances of signal outputs (for example, 50%-25%-25%), you have to add more items to create same ratio (for example, if you need 50%-25%-25%, you can put two wool, one axe and one snowball).

Enjoy your randomizer!

## Modernization[]

4-output randomizer

Of course, this machine can be modernized up to 4-output randomizer.

Modernization of 4-output is actually a repeating of 7-8 steps, just on the second side, but we also take into filter ***golden hoe (or any other non-stackable item)*** along with snowball as non-stackable item and 16(64)-stacked item. The result must look like on the screenshot at the right. Most importantly, don`t forget to put golden hoe into the dropper for it to work properly.

*P.S.* If you don`t like the output locations and you want to change it, you can use wireless redstone link to navigate the signal in 128 blocks range.

## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Crafting[]

### Wrench[]

Shift-right-clicking on a Mechanical Drill with a Wrench will destroy the Mechanical Drill and place it in your inventory.

## Usage[]

### Breaking Blocks[]

A stationary Mechanical Drill will break blocks in the block in front of it with a time in seconds of (45 x Hardness)/RPM and will hurt entities in an area around it.

A Mechanical Drill moved by Contraptions will break blocks and damage entities with which it collides without needing a direct supply of Rotational Force.

The time it takes for a Mechanical Drill to break a block is based on the Contraption’s speed and the block’s Hardness value. The damage dealt to entities is also based on the Contraption’s speed.

## History[]

- 0.2.3: Drills break columns of falling blocks from top to bottom. Contraptions stall longer when breaking falling blocks.
- 0.2: Broken blocks are now placed into the inventory of a Contraption.
- 0.1: Introduced.

# Radiation

Radiation is a status effect implemented by Mechanism. It affects the player with a lingering damaging effect until they die, or manage to wait out until their radiation levels lower to a safe number, viewable by a Dosimeter. A radiation dose of approximately 10 μsv will cause a green tint to be applied to the screen and damage occurs at approximately 60 μsv, This damage will continue until either the player dies or absorbed radiation dosage naturally lowers below the threshold

## Radiation Sources

- A Fission Reactor meltdown
- A reactor waste vent is not properly setup
- Breaking any machine with waste or radioactive gas such as Polonium still in it
- Breaking Radioactive Waste Barrels

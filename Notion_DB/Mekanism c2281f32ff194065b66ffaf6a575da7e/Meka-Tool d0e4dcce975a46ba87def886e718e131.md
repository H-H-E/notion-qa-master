The Meka-Tool is a multi-use tool item in Mekanism. It has almost no use default but can have Modules installed to give it a wide range of functions. While the Configurator is required to craft the Meka-Tool, It does not have that functionality.

## Modules

These are Modules that can be installed in the Meka-Tool at a Modification Station.

- Attack Amplification Unit
- Blasting Unit
- Energy Unit
- Excavation Escalation Unit
- Farming Unit
- Ore Refinement Unit
- Shearing Unit
- Silk Touch Unit
- Teleportation Unit
- Vein Mining Unit

In order to change the settings on your Meka-Tool, you will need to enter the Module Tweaker menu. By default, you can get to this menu with "". Once in the menu (1) click on the Meka-Tool in the bottom bar, and (2) click on the module whose settings you want to modify. From there, we have several options to change the functionality of the module, including a slider that controls bonus attack damage. Simply (3)set the slider to the damage setting you wish. As an example, below is a screenshot of how to change the default attack damage provided by 4 installed Attack Amplification Units.

A Mekanism machine upgrade to make them process items faster, you can install 8 of these in each Mekanism machine. If you were to apply speed upgrades to a factory, the power consumption is accumulative. For example, if each operation were to cost 50J/t, a basic factory with 3 ongoing operations will cost 150J/t.

**HINT:** Upgrade your power setup before upgrading your machines, as the power usage per tick begins to escalate with every speed upgrade applied, requiring more power to complete a single machine process.

**HINT:** If you plan to use Speed Upgrades for a machine, it is advised to also install Energy Upgrades and Gas Upgrades if applicable.

Here’s a tables:

# of Speed Upgrades | Speed Multiplier | Time per Operation (20 ticks = 1 sec) | Relative Speed | Power Usage | Total Power Usage for each Operation |
— | — | — | — | — | — |
0 | 1x | 200 ticks | 100% | 50 J/t | 10,000 J |
1 | 1.33x | 149 ticks | 134.2% | 88 J/t | 13,112 J |
2 | 1.78x | 112 ticks | 178.6% | 158 J/t | 17,696 J |
3 | 2.37x | 84 ticks | 238.1% | 281 J/t | 23,604 J |
4 | 3.16x | 63 ticks | 317.5% | 500 J/t | 31,500 J |
5 | 4.22x | 47 ticks | 425.5% | 889 J/t | 41,783 J |
6 | 5.62x | 35 ticks | 571.4% | 1,580 J/t | 55,300 J |
7 | 7.5x | 26 ticks | 769.2% | 2,810 J/t | 73,060 J |
8 | 10.0x | 20 ticks | 1000% | 5,000 J/t | 100,000 J |

Note that every speed upgrade makes the machine 33% faster, and the Power Usage increases with ~77% (33²%), which makes for an increase in power usage for each operation with 33%

The formula to calculate the energy used is **DefaultUsage × EnergyMultiplier(2 × SpeedUpgrades-EnergyUpgrades)/8**. DefaultUsage is the default energy used by a machine. EnergyMultiplier is a configurable multiplier that defaults to **10**.

This table qualifies the rate of energy/speed efficiency with varying amounts of upgrades applied.

Speed/Energy | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
— | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

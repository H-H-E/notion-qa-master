# Turbine_Blades

A Turbine Blade is an essential part of the Industrial Turbine. The blades are fitted into the turbine rotor, and if you right click any block that is part of the rotor shaft, it will automatically place above the lowest blade, or on the lowest level if there is no blade already on the lowest level. You can fit 2 blades per rotor block.

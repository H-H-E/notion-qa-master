The **Rotary Condensentrator** (pronounced “con-DEN-sen-traitor”) is used for converting substances between liquid and gaseous forms at a rate of 1:1. It has two modes: Decondensentrating, which turns Liquids into Gases, and Condensentrating, which turns Gases into Liquids.

In Decondensentrating mode:

Liquid | → | Gas |
— | — | — |
Water | → | Water Vapor |
Liquid Sulfuric Acid | → | Sulfuric Acid |
Liquid Hydrogen Chloride | → | Hydrogen Chloride |
Liquid Oxygen | → | Oxygen |
Liquid Hydrogen | → | Hydrogen |
Liquid Ethylene | → | Ethylene |
Liquid Chlorine | → | Chlorine |
Liquid Sulfur Dioxide | → | Sulfur Dioxide |
Liquid Sulfur Trioxide | → | Sulfur Trioxide |
Brine | → | Gaseous Brine |
Liquid Lithium | → | Lithium |

and the opposite is true in Condensentrating mode.

Extract liquids with Mechanical Pipe by setting them to “pull” (use a Configurator and Shift+Right click the outer edges of the pipe).

“Using experimental technologies and the tremendous energy of antimatter, allows the user to defy gravity.”

Gravitational Modulating Units are modules that allows the user to utilize creative flight. If the MekaSuit bodyarmor also has a Jetpack Unit installed, the Jetpack Unit will be automatically disabled if the Gravitational Modulating Unit is enabled, and vice versa.

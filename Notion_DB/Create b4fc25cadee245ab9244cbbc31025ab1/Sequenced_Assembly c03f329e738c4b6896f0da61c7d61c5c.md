## Usage[]

Sequenced Assembly starts with a base item. The item passes through or under machines like Deployers and Mechanical Saws via Depots or Mechanical Belts to create an incomplete item. The incomplete item needs to pass through the next stages of crafting and may need to repeat the whole process multiple times depending on the item being crafted.

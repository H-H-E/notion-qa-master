## Usage[]

Right clicking a component with the Wrench will rotate the component toward or away the face with which you interacted.

Right clicking a component, redstone component, rail or vanilla rail variant will dismantle it and place it in your inventory. Any block which can be rotated or otherwise interacted with using right click must be dismantled while sneaking.

Hovering over certain configurable components will allow configuration by scrolling.

For certain components such as the Linear Chassis, ctrl can be held to configure all connected components at once.

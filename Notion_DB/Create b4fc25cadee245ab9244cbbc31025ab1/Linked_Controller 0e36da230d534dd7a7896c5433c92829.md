## Usage[]

The **Linked Controller** uses player movement keys (walk, jump, and sneak) to activate Redstone Links.

To configure the **Linked Controller**, the player can Use the **Linked Controller** on an existing Redstone Link and press any movement key to bind Redstone Links with that frequency to that key. The player can also sneak-use with the **Linked Controller** to open the interface and manually assign frequencies to each movement key.

When used, the player will be locked in place, movement keys instead triggering the corresponding Redstone Links. Use it again or scroll away from the controller to leave this state.

The Linked Controller can also be placed on a Lectern and used.

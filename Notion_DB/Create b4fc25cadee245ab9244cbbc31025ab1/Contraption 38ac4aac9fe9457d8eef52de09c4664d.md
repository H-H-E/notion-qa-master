## Obtaining[]

Contraptions can be made by using contraption controllers such as:

- Mechanical Piston
- Cart Assembler
- Gantry Carriage
- Mechanical Bearing
    - Windmill Bearing
    - Clockwork Bearing
- Rope Pulley
- Trains

## Usage[]

### Creation[]

A minecart contraption with a Mechanical Bearing.

Each Contraption anchor has at least one sticky side and can move at least one block with no extra utilities. Multiple blocks can be moved with the use of Block Attachment Utilities such as:

- Linear Chassis
- Radial Chassis
- Super Glue
- Sticker
- Slime Block
- Honey Block

Blocks that attach to other blocks, such as Levers, Signs, or Torches, will automatically become part of the Contraption. Blocks that automatically attach to other blocks of the same type, such as Sails, Piston Extension Poles, Mechanical Belts, and Gantry Shafts, only need to be glued in one place.

Blocks can stick to sticky chassis, but chassis won’t stick to blocks on their own. Slime Blocks and Honey Blocks on Contraptions will not pick up Glazed Terracotta. They will still pick up other blocks such as Furnaces.

A Mechanical Bearing can be added to a Contraption to attach a second Contraption that keeps one alignment as the structure moves. It can be attached at any orientation.

### Unmovable Blocks[]

Certain blocks cannot be moved by Contraptions by default. Other blocks can be moved, but when on Minecart Contraptions, the cart cannot be picked up with a Wrench. For certain blocks, this is adjustable in the config. Contraption anchors are also unmovable while they are active.

### Movement Modes[]

Most Contraption anchors have movement modes that can be changed by hovering over them with a Wrench and scrolling. Most anchors include “Always place when stopped,” “Only place near starting position,” and “Only place when anchor is destroyed,” determining when the blocks are placed back into the world. Cart Assemblers have “always face movement,” “pause actors while rotating,” and “lock rotation.”

### Collision[]

Gantry Carriages, Rope Pulleys, and Mechanical Pistons will stop moving if an unmovable block or set of blocks is in their path. Trains, Cart Assembler Contraptions, and Bearings will only collide with blocks if the appropriate world interaction block makes the collision.

Entities will also collide with Contraptions.

### Contraption Actors[]

Blocks that have special functions on Contraptions.

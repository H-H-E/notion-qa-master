Stairs

## Obtaining[]

### Breaking[]

Wood stairs drop themselves as items when broken with any tool, or with no tool, but an axe is fastest. Non-wood stairs drop themselves as items only if broken with a pickaxe. Compared to slabs, the hardness values (and thus, breaking time) of stairs better reflect the blocks they are made from.[1]

1. ↑ Times are for unenchanted tools as wielded by players with no status effects, measured in seconds. For more information, see Breaking § Speed.

### Natural generation[]

- Cobblestone and stone brick stairs generate naturally in strongholds.
- Nether brick stairs generate naturally in nether fortresses.
- Spruce stairs generate naturally in witch huts and in igloo basements.
- Purpur stairs generate naturally in end cities.
- Oak, dark oak and birch stairs as well as cobblestone stairs generate naturally in woodland mansions.
- Oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia‌[*Bedrock Edition only*][*needs testing*], and dark oak stairs can generate naturally in shipwrecks.
- Dark oak, cobblestone, and mossy cobblestone stairs can generate in pillager outposts.
- Blackstone and polished blackstone brick stairs can generate in bastion remnants.
- Cobbled deepslate, polished deepslate, deepslate brick and deepslate tile stairs can generate in ancient cities.

Ruined portals * Stone brick and mossy stone brick stairs generate in Overworld ruined portals. * Blackstone, polished blackstone, and polished blackstone brick stairs generate in Nether ruined portals.‌[*Java Edition only*][*needs testing*] * Nether brick stairs generate in Nether ruined portals.‌[*Java Edition only*][*needs testing*]

Ocean ruins * Sandstone stairs generate naturally in some warm ocean ruins. * Stone brick stairs generate naturally in some cold ocean ruins.

Villages * Oak and cobblestone stairs generate naturally in plains villages. * Acacia stairs generate naturally in savanna villages. * Sandstone, smooth sandstone, and granite stairs generate in desert villages. * Spruce and diorite stairs generate in snowy tundra villages. * Spruce and cobblestone stairs generate in taiga and snowy taiga villages.

### Crafting[]

Wood stairs must be crafted entirely from one type and color of wood, and they retain the style of that wood’s type and color.

### Stonecutting[]

## Usage[]

### Placement[]

**Stairs Reconfiguration** — *Left:* Original facing when separate. *Right:* Changed shape when adjacent (*top:* inner corner; *bottom:* outer corner).

To place stairs, use a stairs item while pointing at a surface facing the space the stairs should occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the player.

Stairs can be placed either right side up or upside-down:

- Pointing at a block top or the bottom half of a block side places the stairs right side up.
- Pointing at a block bottom or the top half of a block side places the stairs upside-down.

Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material):

- When a stairs’ half-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs’ full-block side wraps into an “L” shape to join the other stairs (it creates an “inner corner”).
- When a stairs’ full-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs’ full-block side shortens to join the other stairs’ full-block side (it creates an “outer corner”).

Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa.

### Walking[]

Walking up stairs is faster than jumping up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn’t cost any exhaustion from the player’s hunger bar, compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn’t make the player hungry at all.

### Behavior[]

Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.

### Fuel[]

Overworld wooden stairs can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

### Note blocks[]

Wooden stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce “bass” sounds.

Stone stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce “bass drum” sounds.

## Trivia[]

- Between Java Edition 1.17 snapshots 20w45a and 21w05a, “Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper Stairs” was the longest name for any block in *Minecraft*, at 41 characters with spaces, or 36 without.
- The April Fools snapshot 20w14∞ included a block called “Swaggiest stairs ever”, which was a stair variant for the netherite block.
